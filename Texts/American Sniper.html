			<p class="x1bm-first" xml:lang="en-us">The events that happened in this book are true, recounted from the best of my memory. The Department of Defense, including high-ranking U.S.N. personnel, reviewed the text for accuracy and sensitive material. Even though they cleared the book for publication, this does not mean they like everything they read. But this is my story, not theirs. We’ve reconstructed dialogue from memory, which means that it may not be word for word. But the essence of what was said is accurate.</p>
			
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">No classified information was used in the preparation of this book. The Pentagon’s Office of Security Review and the Navy requested that certain changes be made for security reasons. Those requests were all honored.</p>
			
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">Many of the people I served with are still active-duty SEALs. Others are working in different capacities for the government, protecting our nation. All may be considered enemies by our country’s enemies, as am I. Because of that, I have not given their full identities in this book. They know who they are, and I hope they know they have my thanks.</p>

			<p class="x2prol-da" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic">Late March 2003. In the area of Nasiriya, Iraq</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm-first" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="initial-caps initial-caps-override">I</span><span class="no-style-override"> looked through the scope of the sniper rifle, scanning down the road of the tiny Iraqi town. Fifty yards away, a woman opened the door of a small house and stepped outside with her child.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The rest of the street was deserted. The local Iraqis had gone inside, most of them scared. A few curious souls peeked out from behind curtains, waiting. They could hear the rumble of the approaching American unit. The Marines were flooding up the road, marching north to liberate the country from Saddam Hussein.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">It was my job to protect them. My platoon had taken over the building earlier in the day, sneaking into position to provide “overwatch”—prevent the enemy from ambushing the Marines as they came through.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">It didn’t seem like too difficult a task—if anything, I was glad the Marines were on my side. I’d seen the power of their weapons and I would’ve hated to have to fight them. The Iraq army didn’t stand a chance. And, in fact, they appeared to have abandoned the area already.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The war had started roughly two weeks before. My platoon, “Charlie” (later “Cadillac”) of SEAL Team 3, helped kick it off during the early morning of March 20. We landed on al-Faw Peninsula and secured the oil terminal there so Saddam couldn’t set it ablaze as he had during the First Gulf War. Now we were tasked to assist the Marines as they marched north toward Baghdad.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I was a SEAL, a Navy commando trained in special operations. SEAL stands for “SEa, Air, Land,” and it pretty much describes the wide ranges of places we operate. In this case, we were far inland, much farther than SEALs traditionally operated, though as the war against terror continued, this would become common. I’d spent nearly three years training and learning how to become a warrior; I was ready for this fight, or at least as ready as anyone can be.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The rifle I was holding was a .300 WinMag, a bolt-action, precision sniper weapon that belonged to my platoon chief. He’d been covering the street for a while and needed a break. He showed a great deal of confidence in me by choosing me to spot him and take the gun. I was still a new guy, a newbie or rookie in the Teams. By SEAL standards, I had yet to be fully tested.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I was also not yet trained as a SEAL sniper. I wanted to be one in the worst way, but I had a long way to go. Giving me the rifle that morning was the chief’s way of testing me to see if I had the right stuff.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">We were on the roof of an old rundown building at the edge of a town the Marines were going to pass through. The wind kicked dirt and papers across the battered road below us. The place smelled like a sewer—the stench of Iraq was one thing I’d never get used to.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“Marines are coming,” said my chief as the building began to shake. “Keep watching.”</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I looked through the scope. The only people who were moving were the woman and maybe a child or two nearby.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I watched our troops pull up. Ten young, proud Marines in uniform got out of their vehicles and gathered for a foot patrol. As the Americans organized, the woman took something from beneath her clothes, and yanked at it.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">She’d set a grenade. I didn’t realize it at first.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“Looks yellow,” I told the chief, describing what I saw as he watched himself. “It’s yellow, the body—”</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“She’s got a grenade,” said the chief. “That’s a Chinese grenade.”</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“Shit.”</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“Take a shot.”</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“But—”</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“Shoot. Get the grenade. The Marines—”</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I hesitated. Someone was trying to get the Marines on the radio, but we couldn’t reach them. They were coming down the street, heading toward the woman.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“Shoot!” said the chief.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I pushed my finger against the trigger. The bullet leapt out. I shot. The grenade dropped. I fired again as the grenade blew up.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">It was the first time I’d killed anyone while I was on the sniper rifle. And the first time in Iraq—and the only time—I killed anyone other than a male combatant.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm-after-txb1 x1bm-after-txb1-override" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="initial-caps initial-caps-override">I</span><span class="no-style-override">t was my duty to shoot, and I don’t regret it. The woman was already dead. I was just making sure she didn’t take any Marines with her.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">It was clear that not only did she want to kill them, but she didn’t care about anybody else nearby who would have been blown up by the grenade or killed in the firefight. Children on the street, people in the houses, maybe </span><span class="italic italic-override">her</span><span class="no-style-override"> child&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">She was too blinded by evil to consider them. She just wanted Americans dead, no matter what.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">My shots saved several Americans, whose lives were clearly worth more than that woman’s twisted soul. I can stand before God with a clear conscience about doing my job. But I truly, deeply hated the evil that woman possessed. I hate it to this day.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm-after-txb1 x1bm-after-txb1-override" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="initial-caps initial-caps-override">S</span><span class="no-style-override">avage, despicable evil. That’s what we were fighting in Iraq. That’s why a lot of people, myself included, called the enemy “savages.” There really was no other way to describe what we encountered there.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">People ask me all the time, “How many people have you killed?” My standard response is, “Does the answer make me less, or more, of a man?”</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The number is not important to me. I only wish I had killed more. Not for bragging rights, but because I believe the world is a better place without savages out there taking American lives. Everyone I shot in Iraq was trying to harm Americans or Iraqis loyal to the new government.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I had a job to do as a SEAL. I killed the enemy—an enemy I saw day in and day out plotting to kill my fellow Americans. I’m haunted by the enemy’s successes. They were few, but even a single American life is one too many lost.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I don’t worry about what other people think of me. It’s one of the things I most admired about my dad growing up. He didn’t give a hoot what others thought. He was who he was. It’s one of the qualities that has kept me most sane.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">As this book goes to print, I’m still a bit uncomfortable with the idea of publishing my life story. First of all, I’ve always thought that if you want to know what life as a SEAL is like, you should go get your own Trident: earn our medal, the symbol of who we are. Go through our training, make the sacrifices, physical and mental. That’s the only way you’ll know.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Second of all, and more importantly, who cares about my life? I’m no different than anyone else.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I happen to have been in some pretty bad-ass situations. People have told me it’s interesting. I don’t see it. Other people are talking about writing books about my life, or about some of the things I’ve done. I find it strange, but I also feel it’s my life and my story, and I guess I better be the one to get it on paper the way it actually happened.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Also, there are a lot of people who deserve credit, and if I don’t write the story, they may be overlooked. I don’t like the idea of that at all. My boys deserve to be praised more than I do.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The Navy credits me with more kills as a sniper than any other American service member, past or present. I guess that’s true. They go back and forth on what the number is. One week, it’s 160 (the “official” number as of this writing, for what that’s worth), then it’s way higher, then it’s somewhere in between. If you want a number, ask the Navy—you may even get the truth if you catch them on the right day.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">People always want a number. Even if the Navy would let me, I’m not going to give one. I’m not a numbers guy. SEALs are silent warriors, and I’m a SEAL down to my soul. If you want the whole story, get a Trident. If you want to check me out, ask a SEAL.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">If you want what I am comfortable with sharing, and even some stuff I am reluctant to reveal, read on.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I’ve always said that I wasn’t the best shot or even the best sniper ever. I’m not denigrating my skills. I certainly worked hard to hone them. I was blessed with some excellent instructors, who deserve a lot of credit. And my boys—the fellow SEALs and the Marines and the Army soldiers who fought with me and helped me do my job—were all a critical part of my success. But my high total and my so-called “legend” have much to do with the fact that I was in the shit a lot.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">In other words, I had more opportunities than most. I served back-to-back deployments from right before the Iraq War kicked off until the time I got out in 2009. I was lucky enough to be positioned directly in the action.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">There’s another question people ask a lot: Did it bother you killing so many people in Iraq?</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I tell them, “No.”</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">And I mean it. The first time you shoot someone, you get a little nervous. You think, can I really shoot this guy? Is it really okay? But after you kill your enemy, you see it’s okay. You say, </span><span class="italic italic-override">Great</span><span class="no-style-override">.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">You do it again. And again. You do it so the enemy won’t kill you or your countrymen. You do it until there’s no one left for you to kill.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">That’s what war is.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I loved what I did. I still do. If circumstances were different—if my family didn’t need me—I’d be back in a heartbeat. I’m not lying or exaggerating to say it was fun. I had the time of my life being a SEAL.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">People try to put me in a category as a bad-ass, a good ol’ boy, asshole, sniper, SEAL, and probably other categories not appropriate for print. All might be true on any given day. In the end, my story, in Iraq and afterward, is about more than just killing people or even fighting for my country.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">It’s about being a man. And it’s about love as well as hate.</span></p>

				<p class="x1bm-first" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="initial-caps initial-caps-override">E</span><span class="no-style-override">very story has a beginning.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Mine starts in
						north-central Texas. I grew up in small towns where I learned the importance
						of family and traditional values, like patriotism, self-reliance, and
						watching out for your family and neighbors. I’m proud to say that I still
						try to live my life according to those values. I have a strong sense of
						justice. It’s pretty much black-and-white. I don’t see too much gray. I
						think it’s important to protect others. I don’t mind hard work. At the same
						time, I like to have fun. Life’s too short not to.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I was raised with,
						and still believe in, the Christian faith. If I had to order my priorities,
						they would be God, Country, Family. There might be some debate on where
						those last two fall—these days I’ve come around to believing that Family
						may, under some circumstances, outrank Country. But it’s a close
						race.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I’ve always loved
						guns, always loved hunting, and in a way I guess you could say I’ve always
						been a cowboy. I was riding horses from the time I could walk. I wouldn’t
						call myself a true cowboy today, because it’s been a long time since I’ve
						worked a ranch, and I’ve probably lost a lot of what I had in the saddle.
						Still, in my heart if I’m not a SEAL I’m a cowboy, or should be. Problem is,
						it’s a hard way to make a living when you have a family.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I don’t remember
						when I started hunting, but it would have been when I was very young. My
						family had a deer lease a few miles from our house, and we would hunt every
						winter. (For you Yankees: a deer lease is a property where the owner rents
						or leases hunting rights out for a certain amount of time; you pay your
						money and you get the right to go out and hunt. Y’all probably have
						different arrangements where you live, but this one is pretty common down
						here.) Besides deer, we’d hunt turkey, doves, quail—whatever was in season.
						“We” meant my mom, my dad, and my brother, who’s four years younger than me.
						We’d spend the weekends in an old RV trailer. It wasn’t very big, but we
						were a tight little family and we had a lot of fun.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">My father worked
						for Southwestern Bell and AT&amp;T—they split and then came back together
						over the length of his career. He was a manager, and as he’d get promoted
						we’d have to move every few years. So in a way I was raised all over
						Texas.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Even though he was
						successful, my father hated his job. Not the work, really, but what went
						along with it. The bureaucracy. The fact that he had to work in an office.
						He </span><span class="italic italic-override">really</span><span class="no-style-override"> hated having to wear a suit and tie every
						day.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“I don’t care how
						much money you get,” my dad used to tell me. “It’s not worth it if you’re

						philosophy.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">In a lot of ways my
						father was my best friend growing up, but he was able at the same time to
						combine that with a good dose of fatherly discipline. There was a line and I
						never wanted to cross it. I got my share of whuppin’s (you Yankees will call
						’em spankings) when I deserved it, but not to excess and never in anger. If
						my dad was mad, he’d give himself a few minutes to calm down before
						administering a controlled whuppin’—followed by a hug.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">To hear my brother
						tell it, he and I were at each other’s throats most of the time. I don’t
						know if that’s true, but we did have our share of tussles. He was younger
						and smaller than me, but he could give as good he got, and he’d never give
						up. He’s a tough character and one of my closest friends to this day. We
						gave each other hell, but we also had a lot of fun and always knew we had
						each other’s back.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Our high school
						used to have a statue of a panther in the front lobby. We had a tradition
						each year where seniors would try and put incoming freshmen on the panther
						as a hazing ritual. Freshmen, naturally, resisted. I had graduated when my
						brother became a freshman, but I came back on his first day of school and
						offered a hundred dollars to anyone who could sit him on that
					statue.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I still have that

						started a fight. We were supposed to be above that.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Defending myself
						was a different story. Protecting my brother was even better—if someone
						tried to pick on him, I’d lay them out. I was the only one allowed to whip
						him.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Somewhere along the

						felt I had to look out for them. It became my duty.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Maybe it began
						because I was looking for an excuse to fight without getting into trouble. I
						think there was more to it than that; I think my father’s sense of justice
						and fair play influenced me more than I knew at the time, and even more than
						I can say as an adult. But whatever the reason, it sure gave me plenty of
						opportunities for getting into scrapes.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1 x1bm-after-txb1-override" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="initial-caps initial-caps-override">M</span><span class="no-style-override">y family had a deep faith in God. My dad was a

						young when we would go to church every Sunday morning, Sunday night, and
						Wednesday evening. Still, we didn’t consider ourselves overly religious,
						just good people who believed in God and were involved in our church. Truth
						is, back then I didn’t like going a lot of the time.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">My dad worked hard.
						I suspect it was in his blood—his father was a Kansas farmer, and those
						people worked hard. One job was never enough for my dad—he had a feed store
						for a bit when I was growing up, and we had a pretty modest-sized ranch we
						all worked to keep going. He’s retired now, officially, but you can still
						find him working for a local veterinarian when he’s not tending to things on
						his small ranch.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">My mother was also
						a really hard worker. When my brother and I were old enough to be on our
						own, she went to work as a counselor at a juvenile detention center. It was
						a rough job, dealing with difficult kids all day long, and eventually she
						moved on. She’s retired now, too, though she keeps herself busy with
						part-time work and her grandchildren.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Ranching helped
						fill out my school days. My brother and I would have our different chores
						after school and on the weekends: feed and look after the horses, ride
						through the cattle, inspect the fences.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Cattle always give
						you problems. I’ve been kicked in the leg, kicked in the chest, and yes,
						kicked where the sun doesn’t shine. Never been kicked in the head, though.
						That might have set me straight.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Growing up, I
						raised steers and heifers for FFA, Future Farmers of America. (The name is
						now officially The National FFA Organization.) I loved FFA and spent a lot
						of time grooming and showing cattle, even though dealing with the animals
						could be frustrating. I’d get pissed off at them and think I was king of the
						world. When all else failed, I was known to whack ’em upside their huge hard
						heads to knock some sense into them. Twice I broke my hand.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Like I said,
						getting hit in the skull may have set me straight.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I kept my head when
						it came to guns, but I was still passionate about them. Like a lot of boys,
						my first “weapon” was a Daisy multi-pump BB rifle—the more you pumped, the
						more powerful your shot. Later on, I had a CO</span><span class="subscript subscript-override">2</span><span class="no-style-override">-powered revolver that looked like the old 1860 Peacemaker Colt model. I’ve
						been partial to Old West firearms ever since, and after getting out of the
						Navy, I’ve started collecting some very fine-looking replicas. My favorite
						is an 1861 Colt Navy Revolver replica manufactured on the old
					lathes.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I got my first real
						rifle when I was seven or eight years old. It was a bolt-action 30-06. It
						was a solid gun—so “grown-up” that it scared me to shoot at first. I came to
						love that gun, but as I recall what I </span><span class="italic italic-override">really</span><span class="no-style-override">
						lusted after was my brother’s Marlin 30-30. It was lever action,

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Yes, there was a
						theme there.</span></p>
				<p class="x1a" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">B</span><span class="small-caps small-caps-override">RONCO </span><span class="no-style-override">B</span><span class="small-caps small-caps-override">USTIN</span>’</p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-a" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="initial-caps">Y</span>ou’re
					not a cowboy until you can break a horse. I started learning when I was in high
					school; at first, I didn’t know a whole heck of a lot. It was just: <span class="italic">Hop on them and ride until they quit bucking. Do your best to
						stay on.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I learned much more
						as I got older, but most of my early education came on the job—or on the
						horse, so to speak. The horse would do something, and I would do something.
						Together, we came to an understanding. Probably the most important lesson
						was patience. I wasn’t a patient person by nature. I had to develop that
						talent working with horses; it would end up being extremely valuable when I
						became a sniper—and even when I was courting my wife.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Unlike cattle, I
						never found a reason to smack a horse. Ride them till I wore them out, sure.
						Stay on them till they realized who was boss, absolutely. But hit a horse?
						Never saw a reason good enough. Horses are smarter than cattle. You can work
						a horse into cooperating if you give it enough time and patience.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I don’t know if I
						exactly had a talent for breaking horses or not, but being around them fed
						my appetite for all things cowboy. So, looking back, it isn’t very
						surprising that I got involved in rodeo competitions while still in school.
						I played sports in high school—baseball and football—but nothing compared
						with the excitement of the rodeo.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Every high school
						has its different cliques: jocks, nerds, and so on. The crew I was hanging
						out with were the “ropers.” We had the boots and jeans, and in general
						looked and acted like cowboys. I wasn’t a </span><span class="italic italic-override">real</span><span class="no-style-override">
						roper—I couldn’t have lassoed a calf worth a lick at that point—but that
						didn’t stop me from getting involved in rodeos around age
					sixteen.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I started out by
						riding bulls and horses at a small local place where you paid twenty bucks
						to ride as long as you could stay on. You would have to supply your own
						gear—spurs, chaps, your rigging. There was nothing fancy about it: you got
						on and fell off, and got on again. Gradually, I stayed on longer and longer,
						and finally got to the point where I felt confident enough to enter some
						small local rodeos.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Bustin’ a bull is a
						little different than taming a horse. They buck forward, but their skin is
						so loose that when they’re going forward, you not only go forward but you
						slip side to side. And bulls can really spin. Let me put it this way:
						staying on top of a bull is not an easy matter.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I rode bulls for
						about a year, without a ton of success. Wising up, I went to horses and
						ended up trying saddle bronc bustin’. This is the classic event where you
						not only have to stay on the horse for eight seconds, but also do so with
						style and finesse. For some reason, I did a lot better in this event than
						the others, and so I kept with it for quite a while, winning my share of
						belt buckles and more than one fancy saddle. Not that I was a champion, mind
						you, but I did well enough to spread some prize money around the
					bar.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I also got some
						attention from the buckle bunnies, rodeo’s version of female groupies. It
						was all good. I enjoyed going from city to city, traveling, partying, and
						riding.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Call it the cowboy
						lifestyle.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1 x1bm-after-txb1-override" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="initial-caps initial-caps-override">I</span><span class="no-style-override"> continued riding after I graduated high school in
						1992 and started going to college at Tarleton State University in
						Stephenville, Texas. For those of you who don’t know it, Tarleton was
						founded in 1899 and joined the Texas A&amp;M University system in 1917.
						They’re the third largest non-land-grant agriculture university in the
						country. The school has a reputation for turning out excellent ranch and
						farm managers as well as agricultural education teachers.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">At the time, I was
						interested in becoming a ranch manager. Before enrolling, though, I had
						given some thought to the military. My mom’s dad had been an Army Air Force
						pilot, and for a while I thought of becoming an aviator. Then I considered
						becoming a Marine—I wanted to see real action. I liked the idea of fighting.
						I also heard a bit about special operations, and thought about joining
						Marine Recon, which is the Corps’ elite special warfare unit. But my family,
						Mom especially, wanted me to go to college. Eventually, I saw it their way:
						I decided I would go to school first, then join the military. Heck, the way
						I looked at it, doing that meant I could party for a while before getting
						down to business.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I was still doing
						rodeo, and getting fairly good at it. But my career ended abruptly around
						the end of my freshman year, when a bronco flipped over on me in a chute at
						a competition in Rendon, Texas. The guys watching me couldn’t open up the
						chute because of the way the horse came down, so they had to pull him back
						over on top of me. I still had one foot in the stirrup, and was dragged and
						kicked so hard I lost consciousness. I woke up in a life-flight helicopter
						flying to the hospital. I ended up with pins in my wrists, a dislocated
						shoulder, broken ribs, and a bruised lung and kidney.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Probably the worst
						part of the recovery was the dang pins. They were actually big screws about
						a quarter-inch thick. They stuck out a few inches on either side of my
						wrists, just like on Frankenstein’s monster. They itched and looked strange,
						but they held my hands together.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">A few weeks after I
						was hurt, I decided it was time to call up a girl I’d been wanting to take
						out. I wasn’t about to let the pins get in the way of a good time. We were
						driving along and one of the long metal screws kept hitting the signal
						indicator as I was driving. It pissed me off so bad I ended up breaking it
						off at the base close to my skin. I don’t guess she was too impressed with
						that. The date ended early.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">My rodeo career was
						over, but I continued partying like I was on tour. I ran through my money
						pretty quick, and so I started looking for work after school. I found a job
						in a lumberyard as a delivery guy, dropping off wood and other
						materials.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I was a decent
						worker, and I guess it showed. One day a fellow came in and started talking
						to me.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“I know a guy who
						owns a ranch and he’s looking for a hired hand,” he said. “I wonder if you’d
						be interested.”</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“Holy hell,” I told
						him. “I’ll go out there right now.”</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">And so I became a
						ranch hand—a real cowboy—even though I was still going to school
						full-time.</span></p>

				<p class="x1bm-after-a" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="initial-caps initial-caps-override">I</span><span class="no-style-override"> went to work for David Landrum, in Hood County,
						Texas, and quickly found out I wasn’t near as much of a cowboy as I thought
						I was. David took care of that. He taught me everything about working a
						ranch, and then some. He was a rough man. He would cuss you up one side and
						down the other. If you were doing good, he wouldn’t say a word. But I ended
						up really liking the guy.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Working on a ranch
						is heaven.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">It’s a hard life,
						featuring plenty of hard work, and yet at the same time it’s an easy life.
						You’re outside all the time. Most days it’s just you and the animals. You
						don’t have to deal with people or offices or any petty bullshit. You just do
						your job.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">David’s spread ran
						ten thousand acres. It was a real ranch, very old-school—we even had a chuck
						wagon during the spring round-up season.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I want to tell you,
						this was a beautiful place, with gentle hills, a couple of creeks, and open
						land that made you feel alive every time you looked at it. The heart of the
						ranch was an old house that had probably been a way station—an “inn” in
						Yankee-speak—back in the nineteenth century. It was a majestic building,
						with screened porches front and back, nice-sized rooms inside, and a big
						fireplace that warmed the soul as well as the skin.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Of course, because
						I was a ranch hand, my quarters were a little more primitive. I had what we
						called a bunkhouse, which was barely big enough for an actual bunk. It might
						have measured six by twelve feet, and my bed took up most of that. There
						wasn’t space for drawers—I had to hang all my clothes, including my
						underwear, on a pole.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The walls weren’t
						insulated. Central Texas can be pretty cold in the winter, and even with the
						gas stove on high and an electric heater right next to the bed, I slept with
						my clothes on. But the worst thing about it was the fact that there wasn’t a
						proper foundation under the floorboards. I was continually doing battle with
						raccoons and armadillos, who’d burrow in right under my bed. Those raccoons
						were ornery and audacious; I must’ve shot twenty of them before they finally
						got the message that they weren’t welcome under my house.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I started out
						riding the tractors, planting wheat for the cattle in the wintertime. I
						moved on to sluffing feed to the cattle. Eventually, David determined I was
						likely to stick around and started giving me more responsibilities. He
						bumped my salary to $400 a month.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">After my last class
						ended around one or two in the afternoon, I’d head over to the ranch. There
						I’d work until the sun went down, study a bit, then go to bed. First thing
						in the morning, I’d feed all the horses, then head to class. Summer was the
						best. I’d be on horseback at five o’clock in the morning until nine at
						night.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Eventually, I
						became the two-year man, training “cut horses” and getting them ready for
						auction. (Cutting horses—also called carving horses, sorting horses,
						whittlers—are trained to help cowboys “cut” cows from the herd. These
						working horses are important on a ranch, and a good one can be worth a good
						amount of money.)</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">This is really
						where I learned about dealing with horses, and became much more patient than
						I had been before. If you lose your temper with a horse, you can ruin it for
						life. I taught myself to take my time and be gentle with them.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Horses are
						extremely smart. They learn quickly—if you do it right. You show them
						something real small, then stop, and do it again. A horse will lick its lips
						when it’s learning. That’s what I looked for. You stop the lesson on a good
						note, and pick up the next day.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Of course, it took
						a while to learn all this. Anytime I messed up, my boss would let me know.
						Right away he’d cuss me out, tell me I was a worthless piece of shit. But I
						never got pissed at David. In my mind, I thought, </span><span class="italic italic-override">I’m better than that and I’ll show
						you</span><span class="no-style-override">.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">As it happens,

						space to think about where I was headed. Studying and classes were not my
						thing. With my rodeo career ended, I decided that I would quit college, stop
						ranching, and go back to my original plan: join the military and become a
						soldier. Since that was what I really wanted to do, there was no sense
						waiting.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">And so, one day in
						1996, I made my way to the recruiters, determined to sign up.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">This recruiting
						station was its own mini-mall. The Army, Navy, Marine, Air Force offices
						were all lined up in a little row. Each one watched as you came in. They
						were in competition with each other, and not necessarily a friendly
						competition, either.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I went to the
						Marine door first, but they were out to lunch. As I turned around to leave,
						the Army guy down the hall called over.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“Hey,” he said.
						“Why don’t you come on in here?”</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">No reason not
						to,</span><span class="no-style-override"> I thought. So I did.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“What are you
						interested in doing in the military?” he asked.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I told him that I
						liked the idea of special operations, and that from what I’d heard of Army
						SF, I thought I’d like to serve in that branch—if I were to join the Army,
						that is. (Special Forces, or SF, is an elite unit in the Army charged with a
						number of special operations missions. The term “special forces” is
						sometimes used incorrectly to describe special operation troops in general,
						but when I use it, I mean the Army unit.)</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">At the time, you
						had to be an E5—a sergeant—before you could be considered for SF. I didn’t
						like the idea of waiting all that time before getting to the good stuff.
						“You could be a Ranger,” suggested the recruiter.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I didn’t know too
						much about Rangers, but what he told me sounded pretty enticing—jumping out
						of airplanes, assaulting targets, becoming a small-arms expert. He opened my
						eyes to the possibilities, though he didn’t quite close the sale.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“I’ll think about
						it,” I said, getting up to leave.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">As I was on my way
						out, the Navy guy called to me from down the hall.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“Hey, you,” he
						said. “Come on over here.”</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I walked
						over.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“What were you
						talking about in there?” he asked.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“I was thinking
						about going into SF,” I said. “But you have to be an E5. So we were talking
						about the Rangers.”</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“Oh, yeah? Heard
						about the SEALs?”</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">At the time, the
						SEALs were still relatively unknown. I had heard a little about them, but I
						didn’t know all that much. I think I shrugged.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“Why don’t you come
						on in here,” said the sailor. “I’ll tell you all about ’em.”</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">He started by
						telling me about BUD/S, or Basic Underwater Demolition/Scuba training, which
						is the preliminary school all SEALs must pass through. Nowadays, there are
						hundreds of books and movies on SEALs and BUD/S; there’s even a pretty long
						entry on our training in Wikipedia. But back then, BUD/S was still a bit of
						a mystery, at least to me. When I heard how hard it was, how the instructors
						ran you and how less than 10 percent of the class would qualify to move on,
						I was impressed. Just to make it through the training, you had to be one
						tough motherfucker.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I liked that kind
						of challenge.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Then the recruiter
						started telling me about all the missions SEALs, and their predecessors, the
						UDTs, had completed. (UDTs were members of Underwater Demolition Teams,
						frogmen who scouted enemy beaches and undertook other special warfare
						assignments beginning in World War II.) There were stories about swimming
						between obstructions on Japanese-held beaches and gruesome fights behind the

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I did.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">He was full of it,

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The Navy did not

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The only problem

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The Navy

						anything that happened to my arm.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">They flat-out

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">David doubled my

						Colorado.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I took the job

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">But wouldn’t you

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">We were about to

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The instructor

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">My arms hadn’t

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I was rewarded with

						and it is the introductory course that all candidates must pass to become
						SEALs. It’s currently given at the Naval Special Warfare Center in Coronado,
						California. It starts with “indoc” or indoctrination, which is designed to
						introduce candidates to what will be required. Three phases follow: physical
						training, diving, land warfare.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">There have been a
						number of stories and documentaries over the years about BUD/S and how tough
						it is. Pretty much everything they’ve said on that score is true. (Or at
						least mostly true. The Navy and the instructors tone it down a bit for
						national consumption on TV reality shows and other broadcasts. Still, even
						the watered-down version is true enough.) Essentially, the instructors beat
						you down, then beat you down some more. When that’s done, they kick your
						ass, and beat what’s left down again.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">You get the

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I loved it. Hated

				<p class="x1bm-after-a" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="initial-caps initial-caps-override">I</span><span class="no-style-override">t had taken me the better part of a year to reach
						that point. I’d joined the Navy and reported for basic training in February
						1999. Boot camp was pretty lame. I remember calling my dad at one point and
						saying that basic was easy compared to ranch work. That wasn’t a good thing.
						I’d joined the Navy to be a SEAL and challenge myself. Instead I got fat and
						out of shape.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">You see, boot camp
						is designed to prepare you to sit on a ship. They teach you a lot about the
						Navy, which is fine, but I wanted something more like the Marines’ basic
						training—a physical challenge. My brother went into the Marines and came out
						of boot camp tough and in top condition. I came out and probably would have
						flunked BUD/S if I’d gone straight in. They have since changed the
						procedure. There’s now a separate BUD/S boot camp, with more emphasis on
						getting and staying in shape.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Lasting over a
						half-year, BUD/S is extremely demanding physically and mentally; as I
						mentioned earlier, the dropout rate can top 90 percent. The most notorious
						part of BUD/S is Hell Week, 132 hours straight of exercise and physical
						activity. A few of the routines have changed and tested over the years, and
						I imagine they will continue to evolve. Hell Week has pretty much remained
						the most demanding physical test, and probably will continue to be one of
						the high points—or low points, depending on your perspective. When I was in,
						Hell Week came at the end of First Phase. But more about that
					later.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Fortunately, I
						didn’t go directly to BUD/S. I had other training to get through first, and
						a shortage of instructors in the BUD/S classes would keep me (and many
						others) from being abused for quite a while.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">According to Navy
						regs, I had to choose a specialty (or Military Occupation Specialty, or MOS,
						as it is known in the service) in case I didn’t make it through BUD/S and
						qualify for the SEALs. I chose intelligence—I naively thought I’d end up
						like James Bond. Have your little laugh.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">But it was during
						that training that I started working out more seriously. I spent three
						months learning the basics of the Navy’s intelligence specialties, and, more
						importantly, getting my body into better shape. It happened that I saw a
						bunch of real SEALs on the base, and they inspired me to work out. I would
						go to the gym and hit every vital part of my body: legs, chest, triceps,
						biceps, etc. I also started running three times a week, from four to eight
						miles a day, jumping up two miles every session.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I hated running,
						but I was beginning to develop the right mind-set: Do whatever it
						takes.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1 x1bm-after-txb1-override" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="initial-caps initial-caps-override">T</span><span class="no-style-override">his was also where I learned how to swim, or at
						least how to swim better.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The part of Texas
						I’m from is far from the water. Among other things, I had to master the
						sidestroke—a critical stroke for a SEAL.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">When intel school
						ended, I was rounding into shape, but probably still not quite ready for
						BUD/S. Though I didn’t think so at the time, I was lucky that there was a
						shortage of instructors for BUD/S, which caused a backlog of students. The
						Navy decided to assign me to help the SEAL detailers for a few weeks until
						there was an opening. (Detailers are the people in the military who handle
						various personnel tasks. They’re similar to human resources people in large
						corporations.)</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I’d work about half
						a day with them, either from eight to noon or noon to four. When I wasn’t
						working, I trained up with other SEAL candidates. We’d do PT, or physical
						training—what old-school gym teachers call calisthenics—for two hours. You
						know the drill: crunches, push-ups, squats.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">We stayed away from
						weight work. The idea was that you didn’t want to get muscle-bound; you
						wanted to be strong but have maximum flexibility.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">On Tuesdays and
						Thursdays, we’d do exhaustion swim—swim until you sink, basically. Fridays
						were long runs of ten and twelve miles. Tough, but in BUD/S you were
						expected to run a half-marathon.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">My parents remember
						having a conversation with me around this time. I was trying to prepare them
						for what might lie ahead. They didn’t know that much about SEALs; probably a
						good thing.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Someone had
						mentioned that my identity might be erased from official records. When I
						told them, I could see them grimace a little.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I asked if they
						were okay with it. Not that they would really have a choice, I
						suppose.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“It’s okay,”
						insisted my dad. My mom took it silently. They were both more than a little
						concerned, but they tried to hide it and never said anything to discourage
						me from going ahead.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Finally, after six
						months or so of waiting, working out, and waiting some more, my orders came
						through: Report to BUD/S.</span></p>
				<p class="x1a" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">G</span><span class="small-caps small-caps-override">ETTING </span><span class="no-style-override">M</span><span class="small-caps small-caps-override">Y </span><span class="no-style-override">A</span><span class="small-caps small-caps-override">SS </span><span class="no-style-override">K</span><span class="small-caps small-caps-override">ICKED</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-a" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="initial-caps initial-caps-override">I</span><span class="no-style-override"> unfolded myself from the backseat of the cab and
						straightened my dress uniform. Hoisting my bag out of the taxi, I took a
						deep breath and started up the path to the quarterdeck, the building where I
						was supposed to report. I was twenty-four years old, about to live my
						dream.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">And get my ass
						kicked in the process.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">It was dark, but
						not particularly late—somewhere past five or six in the evening. I
						half-expected I’d be jumped as soon as I walked in the door. You hear all
						these rumors about BUD/S and how tough it is, but you never get the full
						story. Anticipation makes things worse.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I spotted a guy
						sitting behind a desk. I walked over and introduced myself. He checked me in
						and got me squared away with a room and the other administrative BS that
						needed to be handled.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">All the time, I was
						thinking: “This isn’t too hard.”</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">And: “I’m going to
						get attacked any second.”</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Naturally, I had
						trouble getting to sleep. I kept thinking the instructors were going to
						burst in and start whipping my ass. I was excited, and a little worried at
						the same time.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Morning came
						without the slightest disturbance. It was only then that I found out I
						wasn’t really in BUD/S; not yet, not officially. I was in what is known as
						Indoc—or Indoctrination. Indoc is meant to prepare you for BUD/S. It’s kind
						of like BUD/S with training wheels. If SEALs did training wheels.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Indoc lasted a
						month. They did yell at us some, but it was nothing like BUD/S. We spent a
						bit of time learning the basics of what would be expected of us, like how to
						run the obstacle course. The idea was that by the time things got serious,
						we’d have our safety down. We also spent a lot of time helping out in small
						ways as other classes went through the actual training.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Indoc was fun. I
						loved the physical aspect, pushing my body and honing my physical skills. At
						the same time, I saw how the candidates were being treated in BUD/S, and I
						thought, </span><span class="italic italic-override">Oh shit, I better get
						serious and work out more.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">And then, before I
						knew it, First Phase started. Now the training </span><span class="italic italic-override">was</span><span class="no-style-override">
						for real, and my butt </span><span class="italic italic-override">was</span><span class="no-style-override"> being kicked. Regularly and with
						a great deal of feeling.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Which brings us up
						to the point where we started this chapter, with me getting hosed in the
						face while working out. I had been doing PT for months, and yet this was far
						harder. The funny thing is, even though I knew more or less what was going
						to happen, I didn’t completely understand how difficult it was going to be.
						Until you actually experience something, you just don’t know.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">At some point that
						morning, I thought, </span><span class="italic italic-override">Holy shit,
						these guys are going to kill me. My arms are going to fall off and I’m going
						to disintegrate right into the pavement.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Somehow I kept
						going.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The first time the
						water hit me, I turned my face away. That earned me a lot of attention—bad
						attention.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“Don’t turn away!”
						shouted the instructor, adding a few choice words relating to my lack of
						character and ability. “Turn back and take it.”</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">So I did. I don’t
						know how many hundreds of push-ups or other exercises we did. I do know that
						I felt I was going to fail. That drove me—I did not want to fail.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I kept facing that
						fear, and coming to the same conclusion, every day, sometimes several
						times.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1 x1bm-after-txb1-override" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="initial-caps initial-caps-override">P</span><span class="no-style-override">eople ask about how tough the exercises were, how
						many push-ups we had to do, how many sit-ups. To answer the first question,
						the number was a hundred each, but the numbers themselves were almost beside
						the point. As I recall, everyone could do a hundred push-ups or whatever. It
						was the repetition and constant stress, the abuse that came with the
						exercises, that made BUD/S so tough. I guess it’s hard to explain if you
						haven’t lived through it.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">There’s a common
						misunderstanding that SEALs are all huge guys in top physical condition.
						That last part is generally true—every SEAL in the Teams is in excellent
						shape. But SEALs come in all sizes. I was in the area of six foot two and
						175 pounds; others who would serve with me ranged from five foot seven on up
						to six foot six. The thing we all had in common wasn’t muscle; it was the
						will to do whatever it takes.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Getting through
						BUD/S and being a SEAL is more about mental toughness than anything else.
						Being stubborn and refusing to give in is the key to success. Somehow I’d
						stumbled onto the winning formula.</span></p>

				<p class="x1bm-after-a" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="initial-caps initial-caps-override">T</span><span class="no-style-override">hat first week I tried to be as far under the
						radar as possible. Being noticed was a </span><span class="italic italic-override">bad</span><span class="no-style-override">
						thing. Whether it was during PT or an exercise, or even just standing in
						line, the least little thing could make you the focus of attention. If you
						were slouching while in line, they fixed on you right away. If an instructor
						said to do something, I tried to be the first one to do it. If I did it
						right—and I sure tried to—they ignored me and went on to someone
						else.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I couldn’t
						completely escape notice. Despite all my exercise, despite all the PT and
						everything else, I had a lot of trouble with pull-ups.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I’m sure you know
						the routine—you put your arms up on the bar and pull yourself up. Then you
						lower yourself. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">In BUD/S, we had to
						hang from the bar and wait there until the instructor told us to start.
						Well, the first time the class set up, he happened to be standing right
						close to me.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“Go!” he
						said.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“Ugghhhh,” I
						moaned, pulling myself northward.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">Big
						mistake.</span><span class="no-style-override"> Right away I got tagged as
						being weak.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I couldn’t do all
						that many pull-ups to begin with, maybe a half-dozen (which was actually the
						requirement). But now, with all the attention, I couldn’t just slip by. I
						had to do </span><span class="italic italic-override">perfect</span><span class="no-style-override"> pull-ups. And many of them. The instructors
						singled me out, and started making me do more, and giving me a lot of extra
						exercise.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">It had an effect.
						Pull-ups became one of my better exercises. I could top thirty without
						trouble. I didn’t end up the best in the class, but I wasn’t an
						embarrassment, either.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">And swimming? All
						the work I’d done before getting to BUD/S paid off. Swimming actually became
						my </span><span class="italic italic-override">best</span><span class="no-style-override"> exercise. I was one of, if not </span><span class="italic italic-override">the</span><span class="no-style-override">
						fastest, swimmers in the class</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Again, minimum
						distances don’t really tell the story. To qualify, you have to swim a
						thousand yards in the ocean. By the time you’re done with BUD/S, a thousand
						yards is nothing. You swim all the time. Two-mile swims were routine. And
						then there was the time where we were taken out in boats and dropped off
						seven nautical miles from the beach.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“There’s one way

						Hell Week. It’s five and a half days of continuous beat-down designed to see
						if you have the endurance and the will to become the ultimate
						warrior.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Every SEAL has a
						different Hell Week story. Mine actually begins a day or two before Hell
						Week, out in the surf, on some rocks. A group of us were in an
						IBS—“inflatable boat, small,” your basic six-man rubber dinghy—and we had to
						bring it ashore past those rocks. I was point man, which meant it was my job
						to clamber out and hold the IBS tight while everyone else got off and picked
						it up.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Well, just as I was
						getting set, a huge wave came up in the surf and took the boat and put it
						down on my foot. It hurt like hell, and immediately got numb.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I ignored it as
						much as I could, and eventually wrapped it up. Later on, when we were
						finished for the day, I went with a buddy whose dad happened to be a doctor
						and had him check it out. He did an X-ray and found it was
					fractured.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Naturally, he
						wanted to put it in a cast, but I refused to let him. Showing up at BUD/S
						with a cast would mean I would have to put my training on hold. And if I did
						that before Hell Week, I’d have to go back to the very beginning—and no way
						I was going through everything I’d just been through again.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">(Even during BUD/S,
						you’re allowed to leave base with permission during your off time. And,
						obviously, I didn’t go to a Navy doctor to get the foot checked out, because
						he would have sent me back—known as “roll back”—immediately.)</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The night Hell Week
						was supposed to start, we were taken to a large room, fed pizza, and treated
						to a movie marathon—</span><span class="italic italic-override">Black Hawk
						Down, We Were Soldiers, Braveheart.</span><span class="no-style-override">
						We were all relaxing in a non-relaxing kind of way, since we knew Hell Week
						was about to begin. It was like a party on the </span><span class="italic italic-override">Titanic</span><span class="no-style-override">. The movies got us all psyched up, but we knew that iceberg was out there,
						looming in the dark.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Once more, my
						imagination got me nervous. I knew at some point an instructor was going to
						bust through that door with an M-60 machine gun shooting blanks, and I was
						going to have to run outside and form up on the grinder (asphalt workout
						area). But when?</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Every minute that
						passed added to the churning in my stomach. I was sitting there saying to
						myself, “God</span><span class="italic italic-override">.</span><span class="no-style-override">” Over and over. Very eloquent and
					deep.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I tried to take a
						nap but I couldn’t sleep. Finally, someone burst in and started
						shooting.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">Thank
						God!</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I don’t think I’ve
						ever been so happy to be abused in my life. I ran outside. The instructors
						were throwing flash-crashes and had the hoses going full-blast.
						(Flash-crashes and flash-bang grenades give off an intense flash and make a
						very loud noise when they explode, but won’t injure you. Technically, the
						terms are applied to different grenades used by the Army and Navy, but we
						generally use the names interchangeably.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I was excited,
						ready for what some people think is the ultimate test for SEAL trainees. But
						at the same time, I was thinking, </span><span class="italic italic-override">What the hell is going on?</span><span class="no-style-override"> Because even though I knew all about Hell Week—or
						thought I did—never having experienced it, I really didn’t understand it in
						my bones.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">We were split up.
						They sent us to different stations and we began doing push-ups, flutter
						kicks, star jumpers&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">After that,
						everything ran together. My foot? That was the least of the pain. We swam,
						we did PT, we took the boats out. Mostly, we just kept moving. One of the
						guys was so exhausted at one point, he thought a kayak coming to check on us
						in the boats was a shark and started yelling a warning. (It was actually our
						commander. I’m not sure if he took that as a compliment or not.)</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Before BUD/S began,
						someone told me the best way to deal with it is to go meal-to-meal. Go as
						hard as you can until you get fed. They feed you every six hours, like
						clockwork. So I focused on that. Salvation was always no further than five
						hours and fifty-nine minutes away.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Still, there were
						several times I thought I wouldn’t make it. I was tempted to get up and run
						over to the bell that would end my torture—if you ring this bell, you’re
						taken in for coffee and a doughnut. And good-byes, since ringing the bell
						(or even standing up and saying “I quit”) means the end of the program for
						you.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Believe it or not,
						my fractured foot gradually started to feel better as the week went on.
						Maybe I just became so used to the feeling that it became normal. What I
						couldn’t stand was being cold. Lying out on the beach in the surf, stripped
						down, freezing my ass off—that was the worst. I’d lock arms with the guys on
						either side of me and “jackhammer,” my body vibrating crazily with the
						chills. I prayed for someone to pee on me.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Everybody did, I’m
						sure. Urine was about the only warm thing available at that point. If you
						happen to look out on the surf during a BUD/S class and see a bunch of guys
						huddled together, it’s because somebody out there is pissing and everybody
						is taking advantage of it.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">If that bell was a
						little closer, I might have stood up and gone and rung it, gotten my warm
						coffee and doughnut. But I didn’t.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Either I was too
						stubborn to quit, or just too lazy to get up. Take your pick.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1 x1bm-after-txb1-override" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="initial-caps initial-caps-override">I</span><span class="no-style-override"> had all sorts of motivation to keep me going. I
						remembered every person who told me I’d flunk out of BUD/S. Sticking in was
						the same as sticking it to them. And seeing all the ships out off the coast
						was another incentive: I asked myself if I wanted to wind up out
						there.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">Hell
						no.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Hell Week started
						on Sunday night. Come about Wednesday, I started feeling I was going to make
						it. By that point, my main goal was mostly to stay awake. (I got about two
						hours of sleep that whole time, and they weren’t together.) A lot of the
						beating had gone away and it was more a mental challenge than anything else.
						Many instructors say Hell Week is 90 percent mental, and they’re right. You
						need to show that you have the mental toughness to continue on with a
						mission even when you’re exhausted. That’s really what the idea is behind
						the test.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">It’s definitely an
						effective way of weeding out guys. I didn’t see it at the time, to be
						honest. In combat, though, I understood. You can’t just walk over and ring a
						bell to go home when you’re being fired at. There’s no saying, “Give me that
						cup of coffee and the doughnut you promised.” If you quit, you die and some
						of your boys die.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">My instructors in
						BUD/S were always saying things like, “You think this is bad? It’s going to
						suck more once you get to the Teams. You’ll be colder and more tired once
						you get there.”</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Lying in the surf,
						I thought they were full of shit. Little did I know that in a few years, I’d
						think Hell Week was a cakewalk.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1 x1bm-after-txb1-override" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="initial-caps initial-caps-override">B</span><span class="no-style-override">eing cold became my nightmare.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I mean that
						literally. After Hell Week, I would wake up shivering all the time. I could
						be under all sorts of blankets and still be cold, because I was going
						through it all again in my mind.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">So many books and
						videos have been done on Hell Week that I won’t waste more of your time
						describing it. I will say one thing: going through it is far worse than
						reading about it.</span></p>

						called walk week. By then they’ve beaten you so bad your body feels
						permanently bruised and swollen. You wear tennis shoes and don’t run—you
						just fast-walk everywhere. It’s a concession that doesn’t last for very
						long; after a few days, they start beating the hell out of you
					again.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“Okay, suck it up,”
						the instructors yell. “You’re over it.”</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">They tell you when
						you’re hurt and when you’re not.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Having survived
						Hell Week, I thought I was home free. I traded my white shirt for brown and
						began part two of BUD/S, the dive phase. Unfortunately, somewhere along the
						way I’d gotten an infection. Not long after second phase started, I was in a
						dive tower, a special training apparatus that simulates a dive. In this
						particular exercise, I had to practice with a dive bell, making what is
						called a buoyant ascent while keeping the pressure in my inner and outer
						ears equalized. There are a few methods for doing that; one common one is to
						close your mouth, pinch your nostrils closed, and gently blow through your
						nose. If you don’t or can’t clear properly, there will be
						trouble&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I’d been told this,
						but because of the infection I couldn’t seem to get it. Since I was in BUD/S
						and inexperienced, I decided to just suck it up and take a shot. That was
						the wrong thing to do: I went on down and ended up perforating my eardrum. I
						had blood coming out of my ears, nose, and eyes when I surfaced.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">They gave me
						medical attention on the spot and then sent me to have my ears treated.
						Because of the medical problems, I was rolled back—assigned to join a later
						class once I healed.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">When you’re rolled
						back, you’re in a sort of limbo. Since I had already made it through Hell
						Week, I didn’t have to go all the way back to the start—there’s no repeating
						Hell Week, thank God. I couldn’t just lie on my butt until the next class
						caught up, though. As soon as I was able, I helped the instructors, did
						daily PT, and ran with a class of white shirts (first phase) as they got
						their asses busted.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1 x1bm-after-txb1-override" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="initial-caps initial-caps-override">O</span><span class="no-style-override">ne thing to know about me is that I love dipping
						tobacco.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I have since I was
						a teen. My father caught me with chewing tobacco when I was in high school.
						He was opposed to it, and decided he’d break me of the habit once and for
						all. So he made me eat an entire can of wintergreen mint��flavored tobacco.
						To this day, I can’t even use wintergreen toothpaste.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Other kinds of chew
						are a different story. These days, Copenhagen is my brand of
					choice.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">You’re not allowed
						to have tobacco as a candidate in BUD/S. But being a rollback, I guess I
						thought I could get away with it. One day I put some Copenhagen in my mouth
						and joined the formation for a run. I was deep enough in the pack that no
						one would be paying attention. Or so I thought.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Wouldn’t you know,
						but one of the instructors came back and started talking to me. As soon as I
						answered, he saw I had some dip in my mouth.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">“Drop!”</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I fell out of
						formation and assumed the push-up position.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“Where’s your can?”
						he demanded.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“In my
						sock.”</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“Get
					it.”</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I, of course, had
						to stay in my push-up position while I did that, so I reached back with one
						hand and took it out. He opened the can and put it down in front of me. “Eat
						it.”</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Every time I came
						down from a push-up, I had to take a big bite of Copenhagen and swallow it.
						I had been dipping from the time I was fifteen, and I already regularly
						swallowed my tobacco when I was done, so it wasn’t as bad as you might
						think. It certainly wasn’t as bad as my instructor wanted. Maybe if it had
						been wintergreen, it would have been a different story. It pissed him off
						that I wasn’t throwing up. So he worked me for several hours with all these
						exercises and such. I </span><span class="italic italic-override">did</span><span class="no-style-override"> almost puke—not from the
						Copenhagen but exhaustion.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Finally, he let me
						be. After that, we got along pretty well. It turned out he was a dipper
						himself. He and another instructor from Texas took a liking to me toward the
						end of BUD/S, and I learned a ton from both men as the course went
						on.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1 x1bm-after-txb1-override" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="initial-caps initial-caps-override">A</span><span class="no-style-override"> lot of people are surprised to hear that injuries
						don’t necessarily disqualify you from becoming a SEAL, unless they are so
						serious that they end your Navy career. It makes sense, though, since being
						a SEAL is more about mental toughness than physical prowess—if you have the
						psychological fortitude to come back from an injury and complete the
						program, you stand a decent chance of being a good SEAL. I personally know a
						SEAL who broke his hip so badly during training that it had to be replaced.
						He had to sit out for a year and a half, but he made it through
						BUD/S.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">You hear guys
						talking about getting kicked out of BUD/S because they got into a fight with
						the instructor and beat the crap out of him. They’re lying sacks of shit. No
						one fights with the instructors. You just don’t. Believe me, if you did,

						than ten percent the number that started.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I was one of them.
						I’d started in class 231, but the rollback meant I graduated with
						233.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">After BUD/S, SEALs
						go to advance training—officially known as SQT or SEAL Qualifying Training.
						While I was there, I was reunited with a friend of mine I’d met while at
						BUD/S—Marcus Luttrell.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Marcus and I got
						along right away. It was only natural: we were a couple of Texas
						boys.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I don’t suppose
						you’ll understand that if you’re not from Texas. There seems to be a special
						bond between people from the state. I don’t know if it’s shared experiences,
						or maybe it’s something in the water—or maybe the beer. Texans tend to get
						on pretty well with each other, and in this case we formed an instant
						friendship. Maybe it’s not that much of a mystery; after all, we had a lot
						of experiences in common, from growing up with a love of hunting to joining
						the Navy to toughing out BUD/S.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Marcus had
						graduated from BUD/S prior to me, then went off to do special advanced
						training before returning to SQT. Trained as a corpsman, he happened to
						check me over when I got my first O</span><span class="subscript subscript-override">2</span><span class="no-style-override"> hit while diving. (In layman’s terms, an “O</span><span class="subscript subscript-override">2</span><span class="no-style-override"> hit” occurs when too much oxygen enters your bloodstream during a dive. It
						can be caused by a number of different factors and can be extremely serious.
						My case was very minor.)</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Diving again. I

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The day my incident
						occurred, I was swimming with a lieutenant, and we were determined to get
						the day’s golden fin—an award for the best shit-hot dive of the day. The
						exercise involved swimming under a ship and planting limpet mines. (A limpet
						mine is a special charge that is placed against the hull of a ship.
						Generally, it will have a timed charge.)</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">We were doing
						extremely well when suddenly, while I was underneath the hull of the ship, I
						experienced vertigo and my brain turned into a vegetable. I managed to grab

						tried signaling to me when I wouldn’t take it. I stared blankly into the
						ocean. Finally, my head cleared, and I was able to get out and
						continue.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">No golden fin for

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Though we ended up
						in different Teams, Marcus and I kept in touch as the years went by. It
						seemed like every time I was coming back from a combat deployment, he was

				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1 x1bm-after-txb1-override" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="initial-caps initial-caps-override">T</span><span class="no-style-override">oward the end of SQT, we got orders telling us
						which SEAL Team we were about to join. Even though we had graduated BUD/S,
						we didn’t consider ourselves real SEALs yet; it was only when we joined a
						Team that we would get our Tridents—and even then we’d have to prove
						ourselves first. (The SEAL Tridents—also known as a Budweiser—is a metal
						“device” or badge worn by SEALs. Besides Neptune’s trident, the symbol
						includes an eagle and an anchor.) At the time, there were six Teams, meaning
						three choices on each coast, East and West; my top pick was Seal Team 3,
						which was based out of Coronado, California. I chose it because that team

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">My next two choices

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I’d been told by

						just prayed for someone who was inherently good and nice.</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">A
						girlfriend called and wanted to go down to San Diego. I was living in Long
						Beach at the time, about ninety miles away. I wasn’t going to go but somehow
						she talked me into it.</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">We were
						walking around that night and we passed a bar named Maloney’s. They were
						blaring “Land Down Under” by Men at Work. My friend wanted to go in but they
						had an outrageous cover charge, something like ten or fifteen
					bucks.</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">“I’m
						not doing that,” I told her. “Not for a bar that’s playing Men at
						Work.”</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">“Oh,
						shut up,” my girlfriend said. She paid the cover and in we went.</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">We were
						at the bar. I was drinking and irritable. This tall, good-looking guy came
						over and started talking to me. I’d been talking to one of his friends, who
						seemed like a jerk. My mood was still pretty bad, though he had a certain
						air about him. He told me his name—Chris—and I told him mine.</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">“What
						do you do?” I asked.</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">“I
						drive an ice cream truck.”</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">“You’re
						full of shit,” I told him. “Obviously you’re military.”</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">“No,
						no,” he protested. He told me a bunch of other things. SEALs almost never
						admit to strangers what they really do, and Chris had some of the best BS
						stories ever. One of the better ones was dolphin waxer: he claimed that
						dolphins in captivity need to be waxed so their skin didn’t disintegrate.
						It’s a pretty convincing story—if you’re a young, naive, and tipsy
						girl.</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">Fortunately, he didn’t try that particular one on me—I hope because he
						could tell I wouldn’t fall for it. He’s also convinced girls that he mans an
						ATM machine, sitting inside and doling out money when people put their cards
						in. I wasn’t anywhere near that naive, or drunk, for him to try that
						story.</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">One
						look at him and I could have told he was military. He was ripped and had
						short hair, and had an accent that said “not from here.”</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">Finally, he admitted he was in the service.</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">“So
						what do you do in the military?” I asked.</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">He said
						a bunch of other things and finally I got the truth: “I just graduated from
						BUD/S.”</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">I was
						like, okay, so you’re a SEAL.</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">“Yeah.”</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">“I know
						all about you guys,” I told him. You see, my sister had just divorced her
						husband. My brother-in-law had wanted to be a SEAL—he’d gone through some of
						the training—and so I knew (or thought I did) what SEALs were all
						about.</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">So I
						told Chris.</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">“You’re
						arrogant, self-centered, and glory-seeking,” I said. “You lie and think you
						can do whatever you want.”</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">Yes, I
						was at my charming best.</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">What
						was intriguing was how he responded. He didn’t smirk or get clever or even
						act offended. He seemed truly .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. puzzled.</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">“Why
						would you say that?” he asked, very innocently and genuine.</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">I told
						him about my brother-in-law.</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">“I
						would lay down my life for my country,” he answered. “How is that
						self-centered? That’s the opposite.”</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">He was
						so idealistic and romantic about things like patriotism and serving the
						country that I couldn’t help but believe him.</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">We
						talked for a while more, then my friend came over and I turned my attention
						to her. Chris said something like he was going to go home.</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">“Why?”
						I asked.</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">“Well,
						you were saying about how you never would date a SEAL or go out with
						one.”</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">“Oh no,
						I said I would never marry one. I didn’t say I wouldn’t go out with
						one.”</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">His
						face lit up.</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">“In
						that case,” he said, with that sly little smile he has, “I guess I’ll get
						your phone number.”</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-last" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">He
						hung around. I hung around. We were still there at last call. As I got up
						with the crowd to go, I was pushed against him. He was all hard and muscle-y
						and smelled good, so I gave him a little kiss on his neck. We went out and
						he walked us to the parking lot .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and I started puking my
						brains out from all the Scotch on the rocks I’d been drinking.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">How can you
						</span><span class="italic italic-override">not</span><span class="no-style-override"> love a girl who loses it the first time you meet?
						I knew from the start that this was someone I wanted to spend a lot of time
						with. But at first, it was impossible to do that. I called her the morning
						after we met to make sure she was okay. We talked and laughed a bit. After
						that, I’d call her and leave messages. She didn’t call back.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The other guys on
						the Team started ribbing me about it. They were betting about whether she’d
						ever call me on her own. You see, we talked a few times, when she would
						actually answer the phone—maybe thinking it was someone else. After a while,
						it was obvious even to me that she never initiated.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Then, something
						changed. I remember the first time she called </span><span class="italic italic-override">me.</span><span class="no-style-override"> We
						were on the East Coast, training.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">When we were done
						talking, I ran inside and started jumping on my teammates’ beds. I took the
						call as a sign she was </span><span class="italic italic-override">really</span><span class="no-style-override"> interested. I was happy to
						share that fact with all the naysayers.</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-au" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="bold">Taya:</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">Chris
						was always very aware of my feelings. He is extremely observant in general
						and it is the same with his awareness of my emotions. He doesn’t have to say
						much. A simple question or easy way of bringing something to light reveals
						that he is 100 percent aware of my feelings. He doesn’t necessarily enjoy
						talking about feelings, but he has a sense of when it is appropriate or
						necessary to bring things out that I may have been intent on keeping
						in.</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">I
						noticed it early on in our relationship. We would be talking on the phone
						and he was very caring.</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">We are,
						in many ways, opposites. Still, we seemed to click. One day on the phone he
						was asking what I thought made us compatible. I decided to tell him some of
						the things that drew me to him.</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">“I
						think you’re a really good guy,” I told him, “really nice. And
						sensitive.”</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">“Sensitive?!?” He was shocked, and sounded offended. “What do you
						mean?”</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">“You
						don’t know what sensitive means?”</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">“You
						mean like I go around crying at movies and stuff?”</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">I
						laughed. I explained that I meant that he seemed to pick up on how I was
						feeling, sometimes before I did. And he let me express that emotion, and,
						importantly, gave me space.</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">I don’t
						think that’s the image most people have of SEALs, but it was and is
						accurate, at least of this one.</span></p>

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I woke up one

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I stumbled into the

						smoke pouring out of the World Trade Center in New York.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I didn’t understand
						what-all was happening. Part of me was still sleeping.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Then as we watched,

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I stared at the

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Suddenly I
						remembered that I left my cell phone off. I grabbed it, and saw I’d missed a

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">Kyle, get your
						ass back to base. Now!</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I grabbed Taya’s
						SUV—it had plenty of gas and my truck didn’t—and hauled down to base. I
						don’t know exactly how fast I was going—it might have been three digits—but
						it was certainly a high rate of speed.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Down around San

						lights flashing.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I pulled over. The

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“Is there any

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“Yes, sir,” I told
						him. “I apologize. I’m in the military and I just got recalled. I understand
						you got to write me a ticket. I know I was in the wrong but with all due

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“What branch are

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">Motherfucker,</span><span class="no-style-override"> I thought.
						</span><span class="italic italic-override">I just told you I have to

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“I’m in the Navy,”

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“What do you do in

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">By now I was pretty

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">He closed his
						ticket book.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“I’ll take you to
						the city line,” he told me. “Go get some fuckin’ payback.”</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">He put his lights
						on and pulled in front of me. We went a bit slower than I’d been going when
						he nabbed me, but it was still well past the limit. He took me as far as his
						jurisdiction went, maybe a little farther, then waved me on.</span></p>
				<p class="x1a" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">T</span><span class="small-caps small-caps-override">RAINING</span></p>

						out that we weren’t needed in Afghanistan or anywhere else at that moment.
						My platoon would have to wait roughly a year before we got into action, and
						when we did, it would be against Saddam Hussein, not Osama bin
					Laden.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">There’s a lot of
						confusion in the civilian world about SEALs and our mission. Most people
						think we’re strictly sea-based commandos, meaning that we always operate off
						ships, and hit targets on the water or the immediate coastline.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Admittedly, a fair
						amount of our work involves things at sea��we are in the Navy, after all. And
						from a historical perspective, as briefly mentioned earlier, SEALs trace
						their origins to the Navy’s Underwater Demolition Teams, or UDTs.
						Established during World War II, UDT frogmen were responsible for reconning
						beaches before they were hit, and they trained for a variety of other
						waterborne tasks, such as infiltrating harbors and planting limpet mines on
						enemy ships. They were the mean, bad-ass combat divers of World War II and
						the postwar era, and SEALs are proud to carry on in their wake.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">But as the UDT
						mission expanded, the Navy recognized that the need for special operations
						didn’t end at the beach line. As new units called SEALs were formed and
						trained for this expanded mission, they came to replace the older UDT
						units.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">While “land” may be
						the final word in the SEAL acronym, it’s hardly the last thing we do. Every
						special operations unit in the U.S. military has its own specialty. There’s
						a lot of overlap in our training, and the range of our missions is similar
						in many respects. But each branch has its own expertise. Army Special
						Forces—also known as SF—does an excellent job training foreign forces, both
						in conventional and unconventional warfare. Army Rangers are a big assault
						force—if you want a large target, say an airfield, taken down, that’s their
						thing. Air Force special operators—parajumpers—excel at pulling people out
						of the shit.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Among our
						specialties are DAs.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">DA stands for
						“direct action.” A direct-action mission is a very short, quick strike
						against a small but high-value target. You might think of it as a surgical
						strike against the enemy. In a practical sense, it could range from anything
						like an attack on a key bridge behind enemy lines to a raid on a terrorist
						hideout to arrest a bomb maker—a “snatch and grab,” as some call it. While
						those are very different missions, the idea is the same: strike hard and
						fast before the enemy knows what’s going on.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">After 9/11, SEALs
						began training to deal with the places Islamic terrorists were most likely
						to be located—Afghanistan number one, and then the Middle East and Africa.
						We still did all the things a SEAL is supposed to do—diving, jumping out of
						planes, taking down ships, etc. But there was more emphasis on land warfare
						during our workup than there traditionally had been in the past.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">There was debate
						about this shift far above my pay grade. Some people wanted to limit SEALs
						to ten miles inland. Nobody asked my opinion, but as far as I’m concerned,
						there shouldn’t be any limits. Personally, I’m just as happy to stay out of
						the water, but that’s beside the point. Let me do what I’m trained to do
						wherever it needs to be done.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The training, most
						of it anyway, was fun, even when it was a kick in the balls. We dove, we
						went into the desert, we worked in the mountains. We even got water-boarded
						and gassed.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Everybody gets
						water-boarded during training. The idea is to prepare you in case you’re
						captured. The instructors tortured us as hard as they could, tying us up and
						pounding on us, just short of permanently damaging us. They say each of us
						has a breaking point, and that prisoners eventually give in. But I would
						have done my best to make them kill me before I gave up secrets.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Gas training was
						another kick. Basically, you get hit with CS gas and have to fight through
						it. CS gas is “captor spray” or tear gas—the active ingredient is
						2-chlorobenzalmalononitrile, for all of you chemistry majors. We thought of
						it as “cough and spit,” because that’s the best way to deal with it. You
						learn during training to let your eyes run; the worst thing to do is rub
						them. You’re going to get snotty and you’re going to be coughing and crying,
						but you can still shoot your weapon and fight through it. That’s the point
						of the exercise.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">We went up to
						Kodiak, Alaska, where we did a land navigation course. It wasn’t the height
						of winter, but there was still so much snow on the ground that we had to put
						on snowshoes. We started with basic instruction on keeping warm—layering up,
						etc.—and learned about things like snow shelters. One of the important
						points of this training, which applied everywhere, was learning how to
						conserve weight in the field. You have to figure out whether it’s more
						important to be lighter and more mobile, or to have more ammunition and body
						armor.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I prefer lightness
						and speed. I count ounces when we go out, not pounds. The lighter you are,
						the more mobile you become. The little bastards out there are faster than
						hell; you need every advantage you can get on them.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The training was
						pretty competitive. We found out at one point that the best platoon in the
						Team would be shipped out to Afghanistan. Training picked up from that point
						on. It was a fierce competition, and not just out on the training range. The
						officers were backstabbing each other. They’d go to the CO and dime each
						other out:</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">Did you see
						what those guys did on the range? They’re no good.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The competition
						came down to us and one other platoon. We came in second. They went to war;
						we stayed home.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">That’s about the
						worst fate a SEAL can imagine.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1 x1bm-after-txb1-override" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="initial-caps initial-caps-override">W</span><span class="no-style-override">ith the conflict in Iraq looming on the horizon,
						our emphasis shifted. We practiced fighting in the desert; we practiced
						fighting in cities. We worked hard, but there were always lighter
						moments.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I remember one time
						when we were on a RUT (real urban training). Our command would find a
						municipality that was willing to have us come in and take down an actual
						building—an empty warehouse, say, or a house—something a little more
						authentic than you would find on a base. On this one exercise, we were
						working at a house. Everything had been carefully arranged with the local
						police department. A few “actors” had been recruited to play parts during
						the exercise.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">My role was to pull
						security outside. I blocked out traffic, waving vehicles away as some of the
						local cops watched from the sidelines.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">While I was
						standing there, gun out, not looking particularly friendly, this guy walked
						down the block toward me.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I started going
						through the drill. First I waved him off; he kept coming. Then I shined my
						light on him; he kept coming. I put my laser dot on him; he kept
						coming.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Of course, the
						closer he got, the more convinced I was that he was a role-player, sent to
						test me. I mentally reviewed my ROEs (“rules of engagement”), which covered
						how I was supposed to act.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“What are you, the
						popo?” he asked, sticking his face out toward mine.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“Popo” (a thug’s
						term for police) wasn’t in the ROEs, but I figured he was ad-libbing. The
						next thing on my list was to throw him down. So I did. He started to resist,
						and reached under his jacket for what I assumed was a weapon, which is
						exactly what a SEAL playing a bad guy would do. So I reacted in kind, giving
						a good SEAL response as I wrestled him into the dirt and busted him up a
						bit.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Whatever was under
						his jacket broke and liquid went everywhere. He was cussing and carrying on,
						but I didn’t take the time to think about all that just then. As the fight
						ran out of him, I cuffed him and looked around.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The cops, seated in
						their patrol car nearby, were just about doubled over laughing. I went over
						to see what was up.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“That’s so-and-so,”
						they told me. “One of the biggest drug dealers in the city. We wish we could
						have beat him like you just did.”</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Apparently, Mr.
						Popo ignored all the signs and wandered into the training exercise figuring
						he’d carry on business as usual. There are idiots everywhere—but I guess
						that explains how he got into that line of work in the first
					place.</span></p>

				<p class="x1bm-after-a" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="initial-caps initial-caps-override">F</span><span class="no-style-override">or months, the United Nations Security Council
						pressured Iraq to comply fully with U.N. resolutions, especially those
						requiring inspections of suspected weapons of mass destruction and related
						sites. War wasn’t a foregone conclusion—Saddam Hussein could have complied
						and shown inspectors everything they wanted to see. But most of us knew he
						wouldn’t. So when we got the word that we were shipping out to Kuwait, we
						were excited. We figured we were going to war.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">One way or the
						other, there was plenty to do out there. Besides watching Iraq’s borders and
						protecting the Kurdish minority, who Saddam had gassed and massacred in the
						past, U.S. troops were enforcing no-fly zones in the north and south. Saddam
						was smuggling oil and other items both into and out of his country, in
						violation of the U.N. sanctions. The U.S. and other allies were stepping up
						operations to stop that.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Before we deployed,
						Taya and I chose to get married. The decision surprised both of us. One day
						we started talking in the car, and we both came to the conclusion that we
						should get married.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The decision
						stunned me, even as I made it. I agreed with it. It was completely logical.
						We were definitely in love. I knew she was the woman I wanted to spend my
						life with. And yet, for some reason, I didn’t think the marriage would
						last.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">We both knew that
						there is an extremely high divorce rate in the SEALs. As a matter of fact,
						I’ve heard marriage counselors claim that it is close to 95 percent, and I
						believe it. So maybe that was what worried me. Perhaps part of me wasn’t
						really ready to think about a lifetime commitment. And of course I
						understood how demanding my job was going to be once we went to war. I can’t
						explain the contradictions.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">But I do know that
						I was absolutely in love, and that she loved me. And so, for better or
						worse, make that peace or war, marriage was our next step together. Happily,
						we’ve survived it all.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1 x1bm-after-txb1-override" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="initial-caps initial-caps-override">O</span><span class="no-style-override">ne thing you ought to know about SEALs: when
						you’re new to the Teams, you get hazed. The platoons are very tight-knit
						groups. Newcomers—always called “new guys”—are treated like hell until they
						prove they belong. That usually doesn’t happen until well into their first
						deployment, if then. New guys get the shit jobs. They’re constantly tested.
						They’re always beat on.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">It’s a kind of an
						extended hazing that takes many forms. For example: on a training exercise,
						you work hard. The instructors kick your ass all day long. Then, when you’re
						done, the platoon will go out and party. When we’re out on a training
						mission, we usually drive around in large, twelve-passenger vans. A new guy
						always drives. Which, of course, means he can’t drink when we hit the bars,
						at least not to SEAL standards.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">That’s the mildest
						form of hazing. In fact, it’s so mild it’s not really hazing.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Choking him out
						while he’s driving—that’s hazing.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">One night soon
						after I joined my platoon, we were out partying after a training mission.
						When we left the bar, all the older guys piled into the back. I wasn’t
						driving, but I had no problem with that—I like to sit up front. We were
						speeding along for a while and all of a sudden I heard, “One-two-three-four,
						I declare a van war.”</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The next thing I
						knew, I was pummeled. “Van war” meant it was open season on the new guys. I
						came out of that one with bruised ribs and a black eye, maybe two. I must
						have gotten my lip busted a dozen times during hazing.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I should say that
						van wars are separate from bar fights, another SEAL staple. SEALs are pretty
						notorious for getting into bar scrapes, and I was no exception. I’ve been
						arrested more than once through the years, though as a general rule the
						charges were either never filed or quickly dismissed.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Why do SEALs fight
						so much?</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I haven’t made a
						scientific study of it, but I think a lot is owed to pent-up aggression.
						We’re trained to go out and kill people. And then, at the same time, we’re
						also being taught to think of ourselves as invincible bad-asses. That’s a
						pretty potent combination.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">When you go into a
						bar, you’ll always have someone who will poke a shoulder into you or
						otherwise imply you should fuck off. Happens in every bar across the world.
						Most people just ignore things like that.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">If someone does
						that to a SEAL, we’re going to turn and knock you out.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">But at the same
						time, I have to say that while SEALs </span><span class="italic italic-override">end</span><span class="no-style-override"> a
						lot of fights, we usually don’t start many. In a lot of cases, the fights
						are the result of some sort of stupid jealousy or the need for a dumbass to
						test his own manhood and earn bragging rights for fighting a
					SEAL.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">When we go into
						bars, we don’t just cower down in the corner or lay low. We go in extremely
						confident. Maybe we’re loud. And, with us being mostly young and in great
						shape, people take notice. Girls gravitate toward a group of SEALs, and
						maybe that makes their boyfriends jealous. Or guys want to prove something
						for some other reason. Either way, things escalate and fights
					happen.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1 x1bm-after-txb1-override" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="initial-caps initial-caps-override">B</span><span class="no-style-override">ut I wasn’t talking about bar fights; I was
						talking about hazing. And my wedding.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">We were in the
						Nevada mountains; it was cold—so cold that it was snowing. I had gotten a
						few days leave to get married; I was due to take off in the morning. The
						rest of the platoon still had some work to do.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">We got back that
						night to our temporary base and went inside to the mission-planning room.
						The chief told everybody that we’d relax and have a few beers while we
						mapped out the next day’s operation. Then he turned to me.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“Hey, new guy,” he
						told me. “Go grab the beer and the booze out of the van and bring it in
						here.”</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I hopped
					to.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">When I came back
						in, everyone was sitting in chairs. There was only one left, and it was kind
						of in the middle of a circle of the others. I didn’t think too much about it
						as I sat down.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“All right, this is
						what we’re going to do,” my chief said, standing in front of dry-erase board
						at the front of the room. “The operation will be an ambush. The target will
						be in the center. We will completely encircle it.”</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">That doesn’t
						sound too smart,</span><span class="no-style-override"> I thought.
						</span><span class="italic italic-override">If we come in from every
						direction, we’ll be shooting each other.</span><span class="no-style-override"> Usually our ambushes are planned in an L-shape to
						avoid that.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I looked at the
						chief. The chief looked at me. Suddenly, his serious expression gave way to
						a shit-ass grin.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">With that, the rest
						of the platoon bum-rushed me.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I hit the floor a
						second later. They cuffed me to a chair, and then began my kangaroo
						court.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">There were a lot of
						charges against me. The first was the fact that I had let it be known that I
						wanted to become a sniper.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“This new guy is
						ungrateful!” thundered the prosecutor. “He does not want to do his job. He
						thinks he is better than the rest of us.”</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I tried to protest,
						but the judge—none other than the chief himself—quickly ruled me out of
						order. I turned to my defense attorney.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“What do you
						expect?” he said. “He’s only got a third-grade edu-Kay-shun.”</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“Guilty!” declared
						the judge. “Next charge!”</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“Your Honor, the
						defendant is disrespectful,” said the prosecutor. “He told the CO to fuck
						off.”</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“Objection!” said
						my lawyer. “He told the </span><span class="italic italic-override">OIC</span><span class="no-style-override"> to fuck off.”</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The CO is the
						commanding officer of the Team; the OIC is the officer in charge of the
						platoon. A pretty big difference, except in this case.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“Guilty! Next
						charge!”</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">For every offense I
						was found guilty of—which meant anything and everything they could make up—I
						had to take a drink of Jack Daniels and Coke, followed by a shooter of
						Jack.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">They got me pretty
						wasted before we even got to the felonies. At some point, they stripped me
						down and put ice down my drawers. Finally I passed out.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Then they
						spray-painted me, and for good measure, drew Playboy bunnies on my chest and
						back with a marker. Just the sort of body art you want for your
						honeymoon.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">At some point, my
						friends apparently became concerned about my health. So they taped me to a
						spine board completely naked, took me outside, and stood me up in the snow.
						They left me for a while until I regained some amount of consciousness. By
						then I was jackhammering hard enough to put a hole through a bunker roof.
						They gave me an IV—the saline helps cut down the alcohol in your system—and
						finally took me back to the hotel, still taped to the spine
					board.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">All I remember from
						the rest of the night is being lifted up a bunch of stairs, apparently to my
						motel room. There must have been a few spectators, because the boys were
						yelling, “Nothing to see here, nothing to see!” as they carried me
						in.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1 x1bm-after-txb1-override" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="initial-caps initial-caps-override">T</span><span class="no-style-override">aya washed off most of the paint and the bunnies
						when I met up with her the next day. But a few were still visible under my
						shirt. I kept my jacket tightly buttoned for the ceremony.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">By then, the
						swelling in my face was almost completely gone. The stitches in my eyebrow
						(from a friendly fight among teammates a few weeks early) were healing
						nicely. The cut on my lip (from a training exercise) was also healing pretty
						well. It’s probably not every bride’s dream to have a spray-painted, beat-up
						groom, but Taya seemed happy enough.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The amount of time
						we had for our honeymoon, though, was a sore point. The Team was gracious
						enough to give me three days to get hitched and honeymoon. As a new guy, I
						was appreciative of the brief leave. My new wife wasn’t quite as
						understanding, and made that clear. Nonetheless, we married and honeymooned
						quickly. Then I got back to work.</span></p>

						tanker.”</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I roused myself
						from the side of the boat where I’d been catching some rest despite the cold
						wind and choppy waters. I was soaked from the spray. Despite the fact that I
						was a new guy on my first deployment, I’d already mastered the art of
						sleeping in all sorts of conditions—an unheralded but critical SEAL
						skill.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">An oil tanker
						loomed ahead. A helicopter had spotted it trying to sneak down the Gulf
						after loading up illegally in Iraq. Our job was to get aboard her, inspect
						her papers, and if, as suspected, she was violating the U.N. sanctions, turn
						her over to the Marines or other authorities for processing.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I scrambled to get
						ready. Our RHIB (rigid hulled inflatable boat, used for a variety of SEAL
						tasks) looked like a cross between a rubber life raft and an open speedboat
						with two monster motors in the back. Thirty-six feet long, it held eight
						SEALs and hit upward of forty-five knots on a calm sea.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The exhaust from
						the twin motors wafted over the boat, mixing with the spray as we gathered
						speed. We were hauling at a good pace, riding the wake of the tanker where
						radar couldn’t pick us up. I went to work, taking a long pole from the deck
						of the boat. Our speed dropped as our RHIB cut alongside the tanker, until
						we were just about matching its pace. The Iranian ship’s engines pulsed in
						the water, so loud our own motors were drowned out.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">As we pushed
						alongside the tanker, I extended the pole upward, trying to angle the
						grappling hook at the top onto the ship’s rail. Once the hook caught, I
						jerked the pole down.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Gotcha.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">A bungee cord
						connected the hook to the pole. A steel cable ladder was connected to the
						hook. Someone grabbed hold of the bottom and held it while the lead man
						began climbing up the side of the ship.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">A loaded oil tanker
						can sit fairly low in the water, so low, in fact, that you sometimes can
						just grab the rail and hop over. That wasn’t the case here—the railing was
						quite a bit higher than our little boat. I’m not a fan of heights, but as
						long as I didn’t think too much about what I was doing, I was
					fine.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The ladder rocked
						with the ship and the wind; I pulled myself upward as quickly as I could go,
						my muscles remembering all those pull-ups in BUD/S. By the time I reached
						the deck, the lead guys were already headed toward the wheelhouse and bridge
						of the ship. I ran to catch up.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Suddenly the tanker
						began gaining speed. The captain, belatedly realizing he was being boarded,
						was trying to head for Iranian waters. If he reached them, we’d have to jump
						off—our orders strictly forbade taking any ship outside of international
						waters.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I caught up to the
						head of the team just as they reached the door to the bridge. One of the
						crew got there at roughly the same time, and tried to lock it. He wasn’t
						fast enough, or strong enough—one of the boarding party threw himself
						against the door and bashed it open.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I ran through, gun
						ready.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">We’d done dozens of
						these operations over the past few days, and rarely had anyone even hinted
						of resistance. But the captain of this ship had some fight in him, and even
						though he was unarmed, he wasn’t ready to surrender.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">He made a run at
						me.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Pretty stupid.
						First of all, I’m not only bigger than him, but I was wearing full body
						armor. Not to mention the fact that I had a submachine gun in my
						hand.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I took the muzzle
						of my gun and struck the idiot in his chest. He went right down.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Somehow, I managed
						to slip as well. My elbow flew out and landed straight on his
					face.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">A couple of
						times.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">That pretty much

						VBSS, for Visit, Board, Search, Seize—is a standard SEAL mission. While the
						“regular” Navy has specially trained sailors to handle the job in peacetime,
						we’re trained to handle the searches in places where resistance is likely.
						And in the lead-up to war during the winter of 2002–03, that meant the
						Persian Gulf off Iraq. The U.N. later estimated that, in violation of
						international sanctions, billions of dollars of oil and other items were
						smuggled out of Iraq and into the pockets of Saddam’s regime.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Smuggling took all
						sorts of forms. You’d find oil being carried in wheat carriers, hidden in
						barrels. More commonly, tankers took on thousands and thousands of gallons
						in excess of what they were permitted in the U.N. Oil-for-Food
						program.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">It wasn’t just oil.
						One of the biggest contraband shipments we came across that winter were

						Cichociemnych Spadochroniarzy Armii Krajowej</span><span class="no-style-override">—Special Military Formation GROM of the Dark and
						Silent Parachutists of the Polish Army—better known as GROM. They’re the
						Polish version of the Special Forces, with an excellent reputation in
						special operations, and they worked on the takedowns with us.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Generally, we
						worked off a big ship, which we used as kind of a floating home port for our
						RHIBs. Half of the platoon would go out for one twenty-four-hour period. We
						would sail to a designated spot and drift in the night, waiting. With luck,
						a helo or a ship would radio intel about a ship coming out of Iraq sailing
						pretty low in the water. Anything that had a cargo would be boarded and
						inspected. We’d go out and take it down.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">A few times we
						worked with an Mk-V boat. The Mk-V is a special operations craft that some
						people have compared to World War II–era PT boats. The craft looks like an
						armored speedboat, and its job is to get SEALs into harm’s way as quickly as
						possible. Built out of aluminum, it can haul serious ass—the boats are said
						to hit sixty-five knots. But what we liked about them were their flat decks
						behind the superstructure. Ordinarily, we would load two Zodiacs back there.
						But since the Zodiacs weren’t needed, the whole company would board from the
						RHIBs and stretch out to grab some sleep until ships were spotted. That beat
						leaning across the seat or twisting yourself around to rest on the
						gunwale.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Taking down ships
						in the Gulf quickly became routine. We could take dozens in a night. But our

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The 3,500-ton

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">We had a platoon in

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">You can imagine how

						of his welcome. I couldn’t blame him; in his place, I’d have been pissed
						myself. He and the others eventually came around—they weren’t mad at us;
						they were mad at the situation. Grudgingly, they helped us prepare for the
						mission, then got us aboard a mail-and-resupply helicopter from the USS
						</span><span class="italic italic-override">Nassau,</span><span class="no-style-override"> an amphibious assault ship out in the Indian
						Ocean.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Amphibs, as they’re
						called, are large assault ships that carry troops and helicopters, and
						occasionally Marine Harrier attack aircraft. They look like old-fashioned
						aircraft carriers with a straight-through flight deck. They’re fairly large,
						and have command and control facilities that can be used as forward planning
						and command posts during assault operations.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">There are several
						ways to take down a ship, depending on the conditions and the target. While
						we could have used helicopters to get to the North Korean freighter, </span><span class="no-style-override"> looking at photos of the ship we noticed that there were a number of wires
						running above the deck. Those wires would have to be removed before we could
						land, which would add time to the operation.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Knowing we’d lose
						the element of surprise if we went in with helos, we opted to use RHIBs
						instead. We started doing practice runs off the side of the </span><span class="italic italic-override">Nassau</span><span class="no-style-override">
						with boats that had been brought out there by a Special Boat Unit. (Special
						Boat Units are the SEALs’ dedicated taxi service. They run the RHIBs, Mk-Vs,
						and other SEAL-related vessels. Among other things, the units are equipped
						and trained to make combat insertions, braving fire to get SEALs in and out
						of trouble.)</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The freighter, meanwhile, </span><span class="no-style-override"> continued sailing toward us. We geared up as it came within

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">What?</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The Spanish frigate
						</span><span class="italic italic-override">Navarra</span><span class="no-style-override"> had confronted the North Korean ship, </span><span class="no-style-override"> which had been fooling exactly nobody by sailing without a flag and with
						her name covered up. According to later reports, Spanish spec-op troops went
						in after the freighter failed to comply with the frigate’s orders to stop.
						Of course, they used helicopters, and just as we had thought, were delayed
						by having to shoot out the wires. From what I’ve heard, that delay would
						have given the captain aboard the vessel time to get rid of incriminating
						paperwork and other evidence, that’s what I think happened.</span></p>

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">Whatever.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Our mission was

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">You wouldn’t think
						missiles would be hard to find. But in this case, they were nowhere to be
						seen. The ship’s hold was full of bags of cement—eighty-pound bags. There
						must have been hundreds of thousands.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">There was only one
						place the Scuds could be. We started moving cement. Bag after bag. That was
						our job for twenty-four hours. No sleep, just move bags of cement. I must
						have moved thousands myself. It was miserable. I was covered with dust. God
						knows what my lungs looked like. Finally, we found shipping containers
						underneath. Out came our torches and saws.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I worked one of the
						quickie saws. Also known as a cut-off saw, it looks like a chain saw with a
						circular blade on the front. It cuts through just about anything, including
						Scud containers.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Fifteen Scud
						missiles lay under the cement. I’d never seen a Scud up close before, and to
						be honest, I thought they were kind of cool-looking. We took pictures, then
						waved the EOD guys—“explosive ordinance disposal,” or bomb disposal
						experts—in to make sure they were inert.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">By that point, the
						entire platoon was completely covered with cement dust. A few guys went over
						the side to clean off. Not me. Given my history with dives, I wasn’t taking
						any chances. That much cement, who the hell knows what happens when it
						touches the water?</span></p>

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Of course, they

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Unfortunately, the

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">They were small,

						high-pitched screams, coupled with sprints in the opposite direction, had me
						doubled over. Cheap thrills in Iraq were priceless.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Some of the people

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Doha was a large
						U.S. Army base, and played important roles in both the First and what would
						be the Second Gulf War. We were given a warehouse there and framed-out rooms
						with the help of some Seabees, the Navy combat engineers. We’d come to rely
						on the Seabees for similar support in the future.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Ali al-Salem was
						even more primitive, at least for us. There we got a tent and some shelving

				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1 x1bm-after-txb1-override" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="initial-caps initial-caps-override">I</span><span class="no-style-override"> was in Kuwait when I saw my first desert

						suddenly, it’s black and you feel like you’re in the middle of swirling
						mineshaft, or maybe the rinse cycle in a bizarre washing machine that uses
						sand instead of water.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I remember being in
						an airplane hangar, and even though the doors were closed, the amount of
						dust in the air was unbelievable. The sand was a fine grit that you never

						learned to wear goggles to protect them; sunglasses wouldn’t do.</span></p>

				<p class="x1bm-after-a" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="initial-caps initial-caps-override">B</span><span class="no-style-override">eing a new guy, I was the 60 gunner.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">As I’m sure many of
						you know, “60” refers to the M-60 general-purpose machine gun, a belt-fed
						weapon that has served the U.S. military in a number of versions for several
						decades.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The M-60 was
						developed in the 1950s. It fires 7.62-mm bullets; the design is so flexible
						that it can be used as the basis for a coaxial machine gun in armored
						vehicles and helicopters, and a light, man-carried squad-level weapon. It
						was a workhorse in the Vietnam War, where grunts called it “the Pig” and
						occasionally cursed over the hot barrel, which required an asbestos glove to
						change after firing a few hundred rounds—not particularly convenient in
						combat.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The Navy made
						substantial improvements to the weapon over the years, and it remains a
						potent gun. The newest version is so improved, in fact, that it rates a
						different designation: the Navy calls it an Mk-43 Mod 0. (Some contend it
						should be considered a completely separate weapon; I’m not going to wade
						into that debate.) It’s comparatively light—in the area of twenty-three
						pounds—and has a relatively short barrel. It also has a rail system, which
						allows scopes and the like to be attached.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Also currently in
						service are M-240s, M-249s, and the Mk-46, a variant of the
					M-249.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">As a general rule,
						the machine guns carried by shooters in my platoons were always called
						</span><span class="italic italic-override">60s,</span><span class="no-style-override"> even when they were actually something else, like
						the Mk-48. We used more Mk-48s as time went on during my days in Iraq, but
						unless it’s significant for some reason, I refer to any squad-level machine
						gun as a 60 and leave others to sort out the fine print.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The old “Pig”
						nickname for the 60 survives, which leads a lot of 60 gunners to be called
						Pigs, or a creative variation; in our platoon, a friend of mine named Bob
						got tagged with it.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">It never applied to
						me. My nickname was “Tex,” which was one of the more socially acceptable
						things people called me.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1 x1bm-after-txb1-override" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="initial-caps initial-caps-override">W</span><span class="no-style-override">ith war becoming inevitable, we began patrolling
						the border across Kuwait, making sure that the Iraqis weren’t going to try
						and sneak across in a preemptory strike. We also began training for a role
						in the upcoming fight.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">That meant spending
						quality time in DPVs, also known as SEAL dune buggies.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">DPVs (“Desert
						Patrol Vehicles”) look extremely cool from the distance, and they are far
						better equipped than your average ATV. There’s a .50-caliber machine gun and
						an Mk-19 grenade launcher on the front, and an M-60 on the back. Then there
						are the LAW rockets, one-shot anti-tank weapons that are the spiritual
						descendants of World War II bazookas and Panzerfausts. The rockets are
						mounted in special brackets on the tubular upper frame. Adding to the
						coolness factor is the sat radio antenna on the very top of the vehicle,
						with a donkey-dick radio antenna next to it.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Practically every
						picture you see of a DPV has the sucker flying over a sand dune and popping
						a wheelie. It is an exceedingly bad-ass image.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Unfortunately, it
						is just that—an image. Not a reality.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">From what I
						understand, the DPVs were based on a design that had been used in the Baja
						races. Stripped down, they were undoubtedly mean mothers. The problem is, we
						didn’t drive them stripped down. All that ordnance we carried added
						considerable weight. Then there were our rucks, and the water and food you
						need to survive in a desert for a few days. Extra gas. Not to mention three
						fully equipped SEALs—driver, navigator, and Pig gunner.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">And, in our case, a
						Texas flag flying off the rear. Both my chief and I were Texans, which made
						that a mandatory accessory.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The load added up
						quickly. The DPVs used a small Volkswagen engine that was, in my experience,
						a piece of junk. It was probably fine in a car, or maybe a dune buggy that
						didn’t see combat. But if we took the vehicle out for two or three days,
						we’d almost always end up working on it for the same amount of time when we
						got back. Inevitably, there was some sort of bearing or bushing failing. We
						had to do our own maintenance. Luckily for us, my platoon included an
						ASCE-certified mechanic, and he took charge of keeping the vehicles
						running.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">But by far their
						biggest drawback was the fact that they were two-wheel drive. This was a
						huge problem if the ground was in the least bit soft. As long as we kept
						going we were usually okay, but if we stopped we ended up in trouble. We
						were constantly digging them out of the sand in Kuwait.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">They were a blast
						when they worked. Being the gunner, I had the elevated seat behind the
						driver and navigator, who sat side by side below me. Geared up with tactical
						ballistic goggles and a helicopter-type helmet, I strapped myself in with a
						five-point restraint and held on as we raced across the desert. We’d do
						seventy miles an hour. I’d let off a few bursts with the .50-cal, then pull
						the lever up on the side of the seat and swivel around toward the back.
						There I’d grab the M-60 and shoot some more. If we were simulating an attack
						from the side while we were moving, I could grab the M-4 I was carrying and
						shoot in that direction.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Shooting the big
						machine gun was </span><span class="italic italic-override">fun</span><span class="no-style-override">!</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Aiming that sucker
						while the vehicle was bounding up and down across the desert was something
						else again. You can move the gun up and down to keep it on target, but
						you’re never going to be particularly precise—at best, you lay down enough
						fire so you can get the hell out of there.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Besides our four
						three-seat DPVs, we had two six-seaters. The six-seater was the
						plain-vanilla version—three rows of two seats, with the only weapon the 60
						on the front. We used it as the command-and-control wagon. Very boring ride.
						It was kind of like riding in a station wagon with Mom when Dad’s got the
						sports car.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">We practiced for a
						few weeks. We did a lot of land navigation, built hide sights, and did SR
						(“surveillance and reconnaissance”) along the border. We’d dig in, cover the
						vehicles with netting, and try and make them disappear in the middle of the
						desert. Not easy for a DPV: usually it ended up looking like a DPV trying to
						hide in the middle of the desert. We also practiced deploying the DPVs out
						of helicopters, riding out the back when they touched down: a rodeo on
						wheels.</span></p>

						worried, not that the war was going to break out, but that it would start
						without us. The usual SEAL deployment at the time was six months. We’d
						shipped out in September, and were due to rotate back to the States within a
						few weeks.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I wanted to fight.
						I wanted to do what I’d been trained for. American taxpayers had invested
						considerable dollars in my education as a SEAL. I wanted to defend my

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I wanted, more than

						I’d see things out of the corner of my eye that weren’t there. I couldn’t
						sleep without all the lights on; I’d read every night until my eyes closed

						much time to think.</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">Chris

				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">“I just

				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">One day
						he told me he had to go out on another helicopter exercise. The next
						morning, I was watching the news and they reported that a helicopter had

				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">In the
						military, “Special Forces” refers to Army special-operations troops, but the
						newscasters had a tendency to use the term for SEALs. Immediately, I jumped
						to conclusions.</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">I
						didn’t hear from him that day, even though he had promised he’d

				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">I told

				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">I

						feel a little more anxious.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Then a little freaked out.
						I couldn’t sleep, though I was exhausted from working and holding back the
						tears that kept threatening to overtake any sense of calm I was
						faking.</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">Finally, around one o’clock, I was starting to crack.</span></p>

						straight toward the back of the helicopter. The rear ramp was not all the

						watching above the ramp speckled with red—the Iraqis had kicked on
						anti-aircraft radars and weapons that intel had claimed didn’t exist, and
						the chopper pilots began shooting off decoy flares and chaff to confuse
						them.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Then came the

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">Damn,</span><span class="no-style-override"> I thought. </span><span class="italic italic-override">We’re going to get shot down before I even

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Somehow, the Iraqis
						managed to miss us. The helicopter kept moving, swooping toward
					land.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“Feet dry!” said
						someone over the radio. We were now over land.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">All hell was
						breaking loose. We were part of a team tasked to hit Iraqi oil resources
						before the Iraqis could blow them up or set them on fire as they had during
						Desert Storm in 1991. SEALs and GROM were hitting gas and oil platforms
						(GOPLATs) in the Gulf, as well as on-shore oil refinery and port
						areas.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Twelve of us were
						tasked to hit farther inland, at the al-Faw oil refinery area. The few extra
						minutes it took translated into a hell of a lot of gunfire, and by the time
						the helicopter touched down, we were in the shit.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The ramp dropped
						and our driver hit the gas. I locked and loaded, ready to fire as we sped
						down the ramp. The DPV careened onto the soft dirt .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and
						promptly got stuck.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">Son of a
						bitch!</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The driver started
						revving the engine and slapping the transmission back and forth, trying to
						budge us free. At least we were out of the helicopter—one of the other DPVs
						got stuck half on and half off the ramp. His 53 jerked up and down, trying
						desperately to free him—pilots hate like hell to get fired at, and they
						wanted out.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">By this time I
						could hear the different DPV units checking in over the radio. Just about
						everybody was stuck in the oil-soaked mud. The intel specialist advising us
						had claimed that the ground would be hard-packed where we were going to
						land. Of course, she and her colleagues had also claimed that the Iraqis
						didn’t have anti-aircraft weapons. Like they say, military intelligence is
						an oxymoron.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“We’re stuck!” said

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“Yeah, we’re stuck

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“We’re stuck,” said

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“Fuck, we got to

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“All right,

						chief.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I undid the
						five-point harness, grabbed the 60 off the back, and humped in the direction
						of the fence that blocked off the oil facility. Our job was to secure the
						gate, and just because we didn’t have wheels to do it with didn’t mean it
						wasn’t getting done.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I found a pile of
						rubble in sight of the gate and set up the 60. A guy came up next to me with
						a Carl Gustav. Technically a recoilless rifle, the weapon fires a bad-ass
						rocket that can take out a tank or poke a hole in a building. Nothing was
						getting through that gate without our say-so.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The Iraqis had set
						up a defensive perimeter outside the refinery. Their only problem was that
						we had landed inside. We were now between them and the refinery—in other
						words, behind their positions.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">They didn’t like
						that all that much. They turned around and started firing at us.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">As soon as I
						realized that we weren’t getting gassed, I threw off my gas mask. Returning
						fire with the 60, I had plenty of targets—too many, in fact. We were heavily
						outnumbered. But that was not a real problem. We began calling in air
						support. Within minutes, all sorts of aircraft were overhead: F/A-18s,
						F-16s, A-10As, even an AC-130 gunship.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The Air Force
						A-10s, better known as Warthogs, were awesome. They’re slow-moving jets, but
						that’s intentional—they’re designed to fly low and slow so they can put a
						maximum amount of gunfire on ground targets. Besides bombs and missiles,
						they’re equipped with a 30-mm Gatling cannon. Those Gatlings chewed the hell
						out of the enemy that night. The Iraqis rolled armor out of the city to get
						us, but they never got close. It got to the point where the Iraqis realized
						they were fucked and tried to flee.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Big mistake. That
						just made them easier to see. The planes kept coming, nailing them. They had
						them zeroed in, and zeroed them out. You’d hear the rounds coming past you

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">A few hours later,
						I got up. Most of the other guys in my company were stirring as well. We
						went outside and started checking the perimeter of the oil fields. While we

						the intel reports didn’t have to be updated—those defenses were now in no
						shape to bother anyone.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">There were dead

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">While we were

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">White civilian

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Something went
						</span><span class="italic italic-override">splat</span><span class="no-style-override"> a few yards from us. The Iraqis had fired a

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“Thank God that

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">White smoke started

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">We started running

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“You can’t come

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">While Marine Cobras

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">When we were still

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Which was a

						observation post.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Our ROEs when the

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">That wasn’t the

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Every night someone

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Looking back, this
						made a lot of sense. Our heaviest weapons were a Carl Gustav and two 60s.
						The Iranians had plenty of artillery, and they had the position dialed in.
						It wouldn’t have taken anything for them to hit us. And, in fact, what they
						were probably trying to do was suck us into a fight so they could kill
						us.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">It did piss us off,

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">After the high of

						gathered them in a pile to be blown up. But that was it. The Iraqis weren’t
						sending boats our way, and the Iranians would only fire a single shot then
						duck and wait for us to react. About the most entertaining thing we could do
						was wade into the water and piss in their direction.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">For a week we took

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">We had an extremely

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">In my experience,

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">We had only one

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">You might think

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">You might be right.

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">We were pissed. We

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">You have to

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">It’s the sort of

						was to reload.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Finally, as the sun

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">When the Marines

						the situation.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">One of the Marines
						outside took an American flag and hoisted it over the position. Someone else
						played the National Anthem—I have no idea where the music came from, but the

						of my most powerful memories.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Every battle-weary
						man rose, went to the window, and saluted. The words of the music echoed in
						each of us as we watched the Stars and Stripes wave literally in dawn’s
						early light. The reminder of what we were fighting for caused tears as well
						as blood and sweat to run freely from all of us.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I’ve lived the
						literal meaning of the “land of the free” and “home of the brave.” It’s not
						corny for me. I feel it in my heart. I feel it in my chest. Even at a ball
						game, when someone talks during the anthem or doesn’t take off his hat, it
						pisses me off. I’m not one to be quiet about it, either.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">For myself and the
						SEALs I was with, patriotism and getting into the heat of the battle were
						deeply connected. But how much a unit like ours can fight depends a lot on
						leadership. Much of it is up to the head shed, the officers who lead us.
						SEAL officers are a real mix. Some are good, some are bad. And some are just
						pussies.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Oh, they may be

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Our top command

<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">And then I would die. I thought of Taya, and how much I loved her. I tried not to get distracted by anything, tried concentrating on the fight.</span></p>

			<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">I had to tell him there were a lot of people who cared, not just for the troops in general, but for him. He had me, he had friends in San Diego and Texas, and family.</span></p>

He’d always been jumpy, but now, when I got up in the middle of the night, I’d stop and say his name before I got back into bed.

			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">That was a key part of the instruction. Since they can’t shoot at you, they put as much pressure on you as they can manage in every other way. From what I’ve heard, only 50 percent of the SEALs who take the school make it through. I can believe it.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The first classes teach SEALs how to use the computers and cameras that are part of our job. SEAL snipers aren’t just shooters. In fact, shooting is only a small part of the job. It’s an important, vital part, but it’s far from everything.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">A SEAL sniper is trained to observe. It’s a foundation skill. He may find himself out ahead of a main force, tasked to discover everything he can about the enemy. Even if he’s assigned to get into position to take out a high-value target, the first thing he has to be able to do is observe the area. He needs to be able to use modern navigational skills and tools like GPS, and at the same time present the information he’s gathered. So that’s where we start.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The next part of the course, and in a lot of ways the hardest, is stalking. That’s the part where most guys fall out. Stalking means sneaking into a position without being seen: easier said than done. It’s moving slowly and carefully to the exact right spot for the mission. It’s not patience, or at least that’s not all it is. It’s professional discipline.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I’m not a patient person, but I learned that to succeed as a stalker I need to take my time. If I know I’m going to kill someone, I will wait a day, a week, two weeks.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Make that, I </span><span class="italic italic-override">have</span><span class="no-style-override"> waited.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I will do whatever it takes. And let’s just say there are no bathroom breaks, either.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">For one of the exercises, we had to sneak through a hay field. I took hours arranging the grass and hay in my ghillie suit. The ghillie suit is made of burlap and is a kind of camouflage base for a sniper on a stalking mission. The suit allows you to add hay or grass or whatever, so you can blend in with your surroundings. The burlap adds depth, so it doesn’t look like a guy with hay sticking out of your butt as you cross a field. You look like a bush.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">But the suits are hot and sweaty. And they don’t make you invisible. When you come to another piece of terrain, you have to stop and rearrange your camouflage. You have to look like whatever it is you’re crossing.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I remember one time I was making my way s-l-o-w-l-y across a field when I heard the distinct rattle of a snake nearby. A rattler had taken a particular liking to the piece of real estate I had to cross. Willing it away didn’t work. Not wanting to give away my position to the instructor grading me, I crept slowly to the side, altering my course. Some enemies aren’t worth fighting.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm-after-txb1 x1bm-after-txb1-override" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="initial-caps initial-caps-override">D</span><span class="no-style-override">uring the stalking portion of our training, you’re not graded on your first shot. You’re graded on your second. In other words, once you’ve fired, can you be seen?</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Hopefully, no. Because not only is there a good possibility you’ll have to take more shots, but you have to get out of there, too. And it would be nice to do that alive.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">It’s important to remember that perfect circles do not exist in nature, and that means you have to do what you can to camouflage your scope and rifle barrel. I would take tape and put it over my barrel, then spray-paint the tape up to camouflage it further. I’d keep some vegetation in front of my scope as well as my barrel—you don’t need to see everything, just your target.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">For me, stalking was the hardest part of the course. I nearly failed because of a lack of patience.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">It was only after we mastered stalking that we moved on to shooting.</span></p>

			<p class="x1bm-after-a" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="initial-caps initial-caps-override">P</span><span class="no-style-override">eople ask a lot about weapons, what I used as a sniper, what I learned on, what I prefer. In the field, I matched the weapon to the job and the situation. At sniper school, I learned the basics of a range of weapons, so I was prepared not only to use them all, but also to choose the right one for the job.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I used four basic weapons at sniper school. Two were magazine-fed semiautomatics: the Mk-12, a 5.56 sniper rifle; and the Mk-11, a 7.62 sniper rifle. (When I talk about a gun, I often just mention the caliber, so the Mk-12 is the 5.56. Oh, and there’s no “point” in front of the numbers; it’s understood.)</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Then there was my .300 Win Mag. That was magazine-fed, but it was bolt-action. Like the other two, it was suppressed. Which means that it has a device on the end of the barrel that suppresses muzzle flash and reduces the sound of bullet as it leaves the gun, much like a muffler on a car. (It’s not actually a silencer, though some think of it that way. Without getting too technical, the suppressor works by letting gas out of the barrel as the bullet discharges. Generally speaking, there are two types, one that attaches to the barrel of the weapon and another that’s integrated with the barrel itself. Among the practical effects of the suppressor on a sniper rifle is that it tends to reduce the amount of “kick” the shooter experiences. This helps make it more accurate.)</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I also had a .50 caliber, which was not suppressed.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Let’s talk about each weapon individually.</span></p>
			<p class="x1c" xml:lang="en-us">Mk-12</p>
			<p class="x1bm-after-c" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="initial-caps">O</span>fficially, the United States Navy Mk-12 Special Purpose Rifle, this gun has a sixteen-inch barrel, but is otherwise the same platform as an M-4. It fires a 5.56 × 45 mm round from a thirty-round magazine. (It can also be fitted with a twenty-round box.)</p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Derived from what became known as the .223 cartridge and therefore smaller and lighter than most earlier military rounds, the 5.56 is not a preferred bullet to shoot someone with. It can take a few shots to put someone down, especially the drugged-up crazies we were dealing with in Iraq, unless you hit him in the head. And contrary to what you’re probably thinking, not all sniper shots, certainly not mine, take the bad guys in the head. Usually I went for center mass—a nice fat target somewhere in the middle of the body, giving me plenty of room to work with.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The gun was super-easy to handle, and was virtually interchangeable with the M-4, which, though not a sniper weapon, is still a valuable combat tool. As a matter of fact, when I got back to my platoon, I took the lower receiver off my M-4 and put it on the upper receiver of my Mk-12. That gave me a collapsible stock and allowed me to go full-auto. (I see now that some Mk-12s are being equipped with the collapsible stock.)</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">On patrol, I like to use a shorter stock. It’s quicker to get up to my shoulder and get a bead on somebody. It’s also better for working inside and in tight quarters.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Another note on my personal configuration: I never used full auto on the rifle. The only time you really want full auto is to keep someone’s head down—spewing bullets doesn’t make for an accurate course of fire. But since there might be a circumstance where it would come in handy, I always wanted to have that option in case I needed it.</span></p>
			<p class="x1c" xml:lang="en-us">Mk-11</p>
			<p class="x1bm-after-c" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="initial-caps initial-caps-override"> O</span><span class="no-style-override">fficially called the Mk-11 Mod X Special Purpose Rifle and also known as the SR25, this is an extremely versatile weapon. I particularly like the idea of the Mk-11 because I could patrol with it (in place of an M-4) and still use it as a sniper rifle. It didn’t have a collapsible stock, but that was its only drawback. I would tie the suppressor onto my kit, leaving it off during the start of a patrol. If I needed to take a sniper shot, I would put it on. But if I was on the street or moving on foot, I could shoot back right away. It was semiautomatic, so I could get a lot of bullets on a target, and it fired 7.62 × .51 mm bullets from a twenty-round box. Those had more stopping power than the smaller 5.56 NATO rounds. I could shoot a guy once and put him down.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Our rounds were match-grade ammo bought from Black Hills, which makes probably the best sniper ammo around.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The Mk-11 had a bad reputation in the field because it would often jam. We wouldn’t have jams that much in training, but overseas was a different story. We eventually figured out that something to do with the dust cover on the rifle was causing a double feed; we solved a lot of the problem by leaving the dustcover down. There were other issues with the weapon, however, and personally it was never one of my favorites.</span></p>
			<p class="x1c" xml:lang="en-us">.300 Win Mag</p>
			<p class="x1bm-after-c" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="initial-caps initial-caps-override"> T</span><span class="no-style-override">he .300 is in another class entirely.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">As I’m sure many readers know, .300 Win Mag (pronounced “three hundred win mag”) refers to the bullet the rifle fires, the .300 Winchester Magnum round (7.62 × 67 mm). It’s an excellent all-around cartridge, whose performance allows for superb accuracy as well as stopping power.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Other services fire the round from different (or slightly different) guns; arguably, the most famous is the Army’s M-24 Sniper Weapon System, which is based on the Remington 700 rifle. (Yes, that is the same rifle civilians can purchase for hunting.) In our case, we started out with MacMillan stocks, customized the barrels, and used 700 action. These were nice rifles.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">In my third platoon—the one that went to Ramadi—we got all new .300s. These used Accuracy International stocks, with a brand-new barrel and action. The AI version had a shorter barrel and a folding stock. They were bad-ass.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The .300 is a little heavier gun by design. It shoots like a laser. Anything from a thousand yards and out, you’re just plain nailing it. And on closer targets, you don’t have to worry about too much correction for your come-ups. You can dial in your five-hundred-yard dope and still hit a target from one hundred to seven hundred yards without worrying too much about making minute adjustments.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I used a .300 Win Mag for most of my kills.</span></p>
			<p class="x1c" xml:lang="en-us">.50 Caliber</p>
			<p class="x1bm-after-c" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="initial-caps initial-caps-override"> T</span><span class="no-style-override">he fifty is huge, extremely heavy, and I just don’t like it. I never used one in Iraq.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">There’s a certain amount of hype and even romance for these weapons, which shoot a 12.7 × 99 mm round. There are a few different specific rifles and variations in service with the U.S. military and other armies around the world. You’ve probably heard of the Barrett M-82 or the M-107, developed by Barrett Firearms Manufacturing. They have enormous ranges and in the right application are certainly good weapons. I just didn’t like them all that much. (The one .50 I do like is the Accuracy International model, which has a more compact, collapsible stock and a little more accuracy; it wasn’t available to us at the time.)</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Everyone says that the .50 is a perfect anti-vehicle gun. But the truth is that if you shoot the .50 through a vehicle’s engine block, you’re not actually going to stop the vehicle. Not right away. The fluids will leak out and eventually it will stop moving. But it’s not instant by any means. A .338 and even a .300 will do the same thing. No, the best way to stop a vehicle is to shoot the driver. And that you can do with a number of weapons.</span></p>
			<p class="x1c" xml:lang="en-us">.338</p>
			<p class="x1bm-after-c" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="initial-caps initial-caps-override"> W</span><span class="no-style-override">e didn’t have .338s in training; we started getting them later on during the war. Again, the name refers to the bullet; there are a number of different manufacturers, including MacMillan and Accuracy International. The bullet shoots farther and flatter than a .50 caliber, weighs less, costs less, and will do just as much damage. They are awesome weapons.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I used a .338 on my last deployment. I would have used it more if I’d had it. The only drawback for me was my model’s lack of a suppressor. When you’re shooting inside a building, the concussion is strong enough that it’s a pain—literally. My ears would hurt after a few shots.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm-after-txb1 x1bm-after-txb1-override" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="initial-caps initial-caps-override">S</span><span class="no-style-override">ince I’m talking about guns, I’ll mention that my current favorites are the weapons systems made by GA Precision, a very small company started in 1999 by George Gardner. He and his staff pay close attention to every detail, and his weapons are just awesome. I didn’t get a chance to try one until I got out of the service, but now they’re what I use.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm-after-txb1 x1bm-after-txb1-override" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="initial-caps initial-caps-override">S</span><span class="no-style-override">copes are an important part of the weapon system. Overseas, I used a 32-power scope. (The powers on a scope refer to the magnification of the focal length. Without getting too technical, the higher the power, the better a shooter can see at a distance. But there are tradeoffs, depending on the situation and the scope. Scopes should be chosen with a mind toward the situation they’ll be used in; to give an obvious example, a 32-power scope would be wildly inappropriate on a shotgun.) Additionally, depending on the circumstances, I had an infrared and visible red laser, as well as night vision for the scope.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">As a SEAL, I used Nightforce scopes. They have very clear glass, and they’re extremely durable under terrible conditions. They always held their zero for me. On deployments, I used a Leica range finder to determine how far I was from a target.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Most of the stocks on my guns used adjustable cheek-pieces. Sometimes called a comb (technically, the comb is the top piece of the stock, but the terms are sometimes interchanged), the extension let me keep my eye in position when sighting through the scope. On older weapons, we would adapt a piece of hard-packed foam and raise the stock to the right height. (As scope rings have gotten larger and more varied in size, the ability to change the stock height has become more important.)</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I used a two-pound trigger on my rifles. That’s a fairly light pull. I want the trigger to surprise me every time; I don’t want to jerk the gun as I fire. I want no resistance:</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">Get set, get ready, put my finger and gently start squeezing, and it goes off.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm-after-txb1 x1bm-after-txb1-override" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="initial-caps initial-caps-override">A</span><span class="no-style-override">s a hunter, I knew how to shoot, how to make the bullet go from point A to point B. Sniper school taught me the science behind it all. One of the more interesting facts is that the barrel of a rifle cannot touch any part of the stock: they need to be free-floating to increase accuracy. (The barrel will “float” in the stock, due to the way the stock is cut out. It attaches only to the main body of the rifle.) When you shoot a round, a vibration comes through the barrel, known as barrel whip. Anything touching the barrel will affect that vibration, and, in turn, affect the accuracy. Then there are things like the Coriolis effect, which has to do with the rotation of the earth and the effect it has on a rifle bullet. (This comes into play only at extremely long distances.)</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">You live all of this technical data in sniper school. You learn about how far to lead someone when they’re moving—if they’re walking, if they’re running, depending on the distance. You keep doing it until the understanding is embedded not just in your brain but in your arms and hands and fingers.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm-after-txb1 x1bm-after-txb1-override" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="initial-caps initial-caps-override">I</span><span class="no-style-override">n most shooting situations, I adjust for elevation, but not for windage. (Simply put, adjusting for elevation means adjusting my aim to compensate for the drop of my bullet over the distance it travels; windage means compensating for the effect of the wind.) The wind is constantly changing. So about the time I adjust for wind, the wind changes. Elevation is a different story—though if you’re in a combat situation, a lot of times you don’t have the luxury of making a fine adjustment. You have to shoot or be shot.</span></p>

			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">After I failed the test, the instructor went through everything with me and my spotter, trying to figure out where I’d gone wrong.

We’re like baseball players with our little rituals and must-dos.

			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">During training and even afterward, I kept my guns a certain way, wore the same clothes, had everything arranged precisely the same.

			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I had to practice to stay sharp. Observation is hard work. I’d go outside and just train myself to spot things in the distance.

In fact, a lot of them like it so much they’ll swim around and play tricks on the others in the exercise. You might have a guy plant his mine, then sink to the bottom and wsait for the next guy to come over with his. There’s usually enough light from above that the second diver is silhouetted and easy to see. So when the victim—I mean, diver—comes to plant his mine, the first diver comes up, grabs his fin, and jerks it.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">That scares the shit out of the second diver. Usually he thinks there’s a shark in the water and screws up the rest of the exercise. And his gear may need a special cleaning.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">On this particular day, I was beneath the ship and had just planted my mine when something grabbed my fin.</span></p>

			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Unfortunately, my officer had given the submarine the wrong grid coordinates for the rendezvous. In fact, they were so far off that there was an island between us and the sub.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Of course, we didn’t know that at the time. We just circled around, trying to make radio coms with a vessel that was too far away to hear us.

			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">We spent just about the entire night out on the water in the Zodiacs. Finally, as dawn approached, our fuel was nearly gone.

Unfortunately, the problem wasn’t discovered until too late, and because of that she couldn’t get an epidural or other painkiller when it came time to give birth. So, she had to give birth naturally, without any training or preparation.</span></p>

			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The problem is, SEAL navigators often don’t get a chance to actually fight in the DA they navigate to. The way we set things up, the navigator is usually assigned to stay in the vehicle while the rest of the unit breaks into the house or whatever. That’s so he can be ready in case we need to get out fast.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Sitting in the passenger seat plugging numbers into a computer was not exactly where I wanted to be. But my chief wanted someone he could count on planning the routes, and when your chief asks you to do something, you do it.</span></p>

						spring of 2003. The country had been liberated from Saddam Hussein and his
						army with the fall of Baghdad on April 9 of that year. But a variety of
						terrorist forces either continued or began fighting after Saddam was
						deposed. They fought both other Iraqis and the U.S. forces who were trying
						to help the country regain stability. Some were former members of Saddam’s
						army and members of the Ba’athist Party that Saddam had headed. There were
						Fedayeen, members of a paramilitary resistance group the dictator had
						organized before the war. There were small, poorly organized groups of Iraqi
						guerrillas, who were also called Fedayeen, though, technically, they weren’t
						connected with Saddam’s organization. Though nearly all were Muslim,
						nationalism rather than religion tended to be their primary motive and
						organizing principle.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Then there were the
						groups organized primarily around religious beliefs. These identified
						themselves as mujahedeen, which basically means “people on jihad”—or
						murderers in the name of God. They were dedicated to killing Americans and
						Muslims who didn’t believe in the brand of Islam that they believed
						in.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">There was also
						al-Qaeda in Iraq, a mostly foreign group that saw the war as an opportunity
						to kill Americans. They were radical Sunni Muslims with an allegiance to
						Osama bin Laden, the terrorist leader who needs no introduction—and whom
						SEALs hunted down and gave a fitting sendoff in 2011.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">There were also

						Mohammad Mohammad Sadeq al-Sadr, a grand ayatollah and an opponent of
						Saddam’s regime during the 1990s. An extremely poor area even by Iraqi

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Muqtada al-Sadr

						force managed to kill a number of American troops and a far greater number
						of Iraqis before the fanatical cleric declared a cease-fire in June. In
						military terms, his offensive failed, but the insurgents remained strong in
						Sadr City.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Meanwhile, mostly
						Sunni insurgents took hold of al-Anbar province, a large sector of the
						country to the west of Baghdad. They were particularly strong in the cities
						there, including Ramadi and Fallujah.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">That spring was the
						period when Americans were shocked by the images of four contractors, their
						bodies desecrated, hanging from a bridge in Fallujah. It was a sign of worse
						to come. The Marines moved into the city soon afterward, but their
						operations there were called off after heavy fighting. It’s been estimated
						that at that point they controlled some 25 percent of the city.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">As part of the
						pullout, an Iraqi force came into the city to take control. In theory, they
						were supposed to keep insurgents out. The reality was very different. By
						that fall, pretty much the only people who lived in Fallujah were
						insurgents. It was even more dangerous for Americans than it had been in the
						spring.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">When I left for

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I still had to
						navigate. My job was to figure out a safe route to and from the target
						house. While the insurgents were active in the Baghdad area, the fighting
						had slowed down and there wasn’t yet the huge threat of IEDs and ambushes
						that you saw elsewhere. Still, that could change in an instant, and I was
						careful plotting my routes.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">We got into our

						to my right was a swing arm for a machine gun. We’d taken the Hummer’s doors
						off to make it easier to get in and out and fire. Besides the mounts on my
						side and in the back, we had a .50 in a turret at the back.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">We reached the

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The Poles put me

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The GROM hit houses
						essentially the way SEALs do. There are little variations here and there:

					control.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">One difference I
						particularly like is their version of flash-crash grenades. American stun
						grenades explode with flash of light and an enormous bang. The Polish

						seven-bangers. They sound like very loud gunfire. I tried to take as many of
						those from them as I could when it was time to move on.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">We moved the

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The room was

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Back outside, I
						hopped into the Hummer and started directing the team back to base. The

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The GROM took care

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">We picked up a

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Zubrówka has been
						around for hundreds of years, though I’ve never seen it in America. There’s
						a blade of buffalo grass in each bottle; each blade comes from the same

						the story related to me from my GROM friends was a lot more colorful—or
						maybe off-color. According to them, European bison known as wisent roam on
						this field and piss on the grass. The distillers put the blades in for an
						extra kick. (Actually, during the process, certain ingredients of the
						buffalo grass are safely neutralized, so just the flavor remains. But my

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I was a little

						I arranged to run some drills with them and gave them a bit of background on
						how SEALs operate. I taught them how we build our hides inside homes and

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">What always seemed

						carried in Iraq. The answer is: it depended. I adjusted my gear slightly
						from deployment to deployment. Here’s how I usually went out:</span></p>
				<p class="x1c" xml:lang="en-us">Pistols</p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-c" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="initial-caps initial-caps-override">T</span><span class="no-style-override">he standard SEAL-issued pistol was a SIG Sauer
						P226, chambered for 9-mm ammo. While that is an excellent weapon, I felt I
						needed more knockdown power than nine millimeters could provide, and later
						started carrying my own personal weapon in place of the P226. Let’s face
						it—if you’re using a pistol in combat, the shit has already hit the fan. You
						may not have the time for perfect shot placement. The bigger rounds may not
						kill your enemy, but they’re more likely to put him down when you hit
						him.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">In 2004, I brought
						over a Springfield TRP Operator, which used a .45-caliber round. It had a
						1911 body style, with custom grips and a rail system that let me add a light
						and laser combo. Black, it had a bull barrel and was an excellent gun—until
						it took a frag for me in Fallujah.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I was actually able
						to get it repaired—those Springfields are tough. Still, not wanting to press
						my luck, I replaced it with a SIG P220. The P220 looked pretty much exactly
						like the P226, but was chambered for .45 caliber.</span></p>
				<p class="x1c" xml:lang="en-us">Carrying My Pistol</p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-c" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="initial-caps initial-caps-override">O</span><span class="no-style-override">n my first two deployments, I had a drop-leg
						holster. (A drop-leg sits against the upper thigh, within easy reach of the
						pistol hand.) The problem with that type of holster is that it tends to move
						around. During combat, or even if you’re simply bouncing around, the rig
						slides over on your leg. So after the first two deployments, I went to a hip
						holster. That way, my gun was always where I expected it to be.</span></p>
				<p class="x1c" xml:lang="en-us">Med Gear</p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-c" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="initial-caps initial-caps-override">E</span><span class="no-style-override">veryone always carried their own “blowout kit,” a
						small set of medical supplies. You always carried the bare necessities to
						treat a gunshot wound—bandages for different wounds, IV, clotting medicine.
						It had to be readily accessible—you didn’t want the person helping you have
						to search for it. I put mine in my right-hand cargo pocket on my leg, under
						the holster. If I’d ever been shot, my buddies could have cut out the bottom
						of the cargo pocket and pulled out the kit. Most guys did it that
						way.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">When you treat
						somebody in the field before the corpsman or a medic gets there, you always
						use the wounded man’s kit. If you use your kit, who’s to say you’ll have it
						for the next guy—or yourself—if you need it?</span></p>
				<p class="x1c" xml:lang="en-us">Body Armor and Rig</p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-c" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="initial-caps initial-caps-override">D</span><span class="no-style-override">uring the first deployment, my SEAL body armor had
						the MOLLE system attached to it. (MOLLE stands for Modular Lightweight
						Load-carrying Equipment, a fancy acronym for a web system where different
						pouches and gear can be attached, allowing you to customize your webbing.
						The word </span><span class="italic italic-override">MOLLE</span><span class="no-style-override"> itself is a trademark for the system developed
						and manufactured by Natick Labs. However, a lot of people use the word to
						describe any similar system.)</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">On the deployments
						that followed, I had separate body armor with a separate Rhodesian rig.
						(Rhodesian describes a vest that allows you to set up a MOLLE or MOLLE-like
						rig. Again, the overall principle is that you can customize the way you
						carry your stuff.)</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Having a separate
						vest allowed me to take my gear off and lay it down, while still wearing my
						body armor. This made it more comfortable to lie down and still be able to
						grab everything I needed. When I was going to be on the sniper rifle, lying
						behind it and peering through the scope, I would unclip the strap and lay
						out the vest. This made my ammo, which I had in the pouches, easier to
						access. Meanwhile, the vest was still attached to my shoulders; it would
						come with me and fall into place when I got up.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">(One note about the
						body armor—Navy-issued body armor has been known to fall apart. In light of
						that fact, my wife’s parents very generously bought me some Dragon Skin
						armor after my third deployment. It’s super-heavy, but it’s extremely good
						armor, the best you can get.)</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1 x1bm-after-txb1-override" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="initial-caps initial-caps-override">I</span><span class="no-style-override"> wore a GPS on my wrist, with a backup in my vest
						and even a backup old-fashioned compass. I went through a couple of pairs of
						goggles per deployment; they had miniature fans inside to keep air
						circulating so they wouldn’t fog up. And, of course, I had a pocketknife—I
						got a Microtech after graduating BUD/S—and Emerson and Benchmade fixed
						blades, depending on the deployment.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Among other
						equipment we’d carry would be a square of a VS-17 panel, used to alert
						pilots to a friendly position so they wouldn’t fire on us. In theory, at
						least.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Initially, I tried
						to keep everything off my waist, even going so far as to carry my extra
						pistol mags in another drop-leg on my other side. (I cinched it up high so I
						could still access the pocket on my left leg.)</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1 x1bm-after-txb1-override" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="initial-caps initial-caps-override">I</span><span class="no-style-override"> never wore ear protection in Iraq. The ear
						protection we had contained noise-canceling circuitry. While it was possible
						to hear gunshots fired by the enemy, the microphone that picked up those
						sounds was omnidirectional. That meant you couldn’t tell what direction the
						shots were coming from.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">And contrary to
						what my wife thinks, I wore my helmet from time to time. Admittedly, it was
						not often. It was a standard, U.S. military–issue helmet, uncomfortable and
						of minimal value against all but the weakest shots or shrapnel. To keep it
						from jostling on my head, I tightened it up using Pro-Tec pads, but it was
						still annoying to wear for long stretches. It added a lot of weight to my
						head while I was on the gun, making it harder to stay focused as the watch
						went on.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I’d seen that
						bullets, even from pistols, could easily go through a helmet, so I didn’t
						have much incentive to deal with the discomfort. The general exception to
						this was at night. I’d wear the helmet so I had a place to attach my night
						vision to.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Otherwise, I
						usually wore a ball cap: a platoon cap with a Cadillac symbol adapted as our
						unit logo. (While officially we were Charlie Platoon, we usually took on
						alternate names with the same letter or sound at the beginning: Charlie
						becomes Cadillac, etc.)</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Why a ball

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Ninety percent of

						wearing a ball cap.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Besides my Cadillac
						cap, I had another favorite—a cap from a New York fire company that had lost
						some of its men during 9/11. My dad had gotten it for me during a visit,
						after the attacks, to the “Lions Den,” a historic city firehouse. There he
						met members of Engine 23; when the firemen heard that his son was going to
						war, they insisted he take the hat.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“Just tell him to
						get some payback,” they said.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">If they’re reading

				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1 x1bm-after-txb1-override" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="initial-caps initial-caps-override">O</span><span class="no-style-override">n my wrist, I’d wear a G-Shock watch. The black
						watch and its rubber wristband have replaced Rolex Submariners as standard
						SEAL equipment. (A friend of mine, who thought it was a shame the tradition
						died, recently got me one. I still feel a little strange wearing a Rolex,
						but it is a throwback to the frogmen who came before me.)</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">In cool weather, I
						brought a personal jacket to wear—a North Face—because, believe it or not, I
						had trouble convincing the supply mafia to issue me cold-weather gear. But
						that’s a rant for a different day.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1 x1bm-after-txb1-override" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="initial-caps initial-caps-override">I</span><span class="no-style-override"> would stick my M-4 and ten mags (three hundred

						whatever. It also can be used to identify friendly troops.)</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">If I had one of my

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">That didn’t work.

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The insurgents were
						one-part terrorists, another-part criminal gangs. They would plant IEDs,
						kidnap officials and their families, attack American convoys, kill Iraqis
						who didn’t share their faith or politics—anything and everything they could

						dedicated to overthrowing the interim government and preventing free
						elections.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Al-Anabar Province
						and, more specifically, the general area around Fallujah became known

						Baqubah—and the ethnic composition.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">(Some background on
						Islam in Iraq: There were two main groups of Muslims in Iraq, Sunnis and
						Shiites. Before the war, Shiites lived mostly in the south and east, say
						from Baghdad to the borders, and Sunnis dominated around Baghdad and to the
						northwest. The two groups coexisted but generally hated each other. While
						Shiites were the majority, during Saddam’s time they were discriminated
						against and not allowed to hold important offices. Farther north, the areas
						are dominated by Kurds, who, though mostly Sunni, have separate traditions
						and often don’t think of themselves as being part of Iraq. Saddam considered
						them to be an inferior people; during one political suppression, he ordered
						chemical weapons used and waged a despicable ethnic-cleansing
						campaign.)</span></p>

						surrounding area and Baghdad, the insurgents spent considerable time
						fortifying the city so they could withstand another attack. They stockpiled
						ammo and weapons, prepared IEDs, and fortified houses. Mines were planted,
						and roads closed off so they could be used for ambushes. “Rat holes” were
						created in compound walls, allowing insurgents to move from one house to
						another, avoiding streets. Many if not all of the two hundred mosques in the
						city became fortified bunkers, since the insurgents knew that Americans
						respected houses of worship as sacred and therefore were reluctant to attack
						there. A hospital was turned into an insurgent headquarters and used as a
						base of operations for the insurgents’ propaganda machine. In sum, the city
						was a terrorist fortress by the summer of 2004.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">In fact, the
						insurgents were confident enough to regularly launch rocket attacks against
						U.S. bases in the area and ambush convoys moving on the main roads. Finally,

						retaken.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The plan they drew

						be rooted out and destroyed.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">While Marines from
						the First Marine Division made up the backbone of the attack force, all of

						Marine assault groups, providing overwatch and performing traditional sniper
						missions.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The Marines spent
						several weeks getting ready for the assault, launching a variety of
						operations to throw the insurgents off-balance. The bad guys knew something
						was coming; they just didn’t know where and when. The eastern side of the

						attack would be launched.</span></p>

						Marine amtrac with a dozen Marines and a few SEALs, all keyed up for battle.
						The big armored vehicle rumbled to life, and slowly moved toward the head of
						a massive procession of armor heading out of camp and north of the city,
						into the open desert.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">We sat knee to knee
						on benches facing each other in the bare-bones interior. A third row had
						been squeezed into the middle of the compartment. The AAV-7A1 wasn’t exactly
						a stretch limo; you might try not to crowd out the guys on either side of
						you, but there was only so much you could do. Tight wasn’t the word.
						Thankfully, just about everyone inside with me had showered
					recently.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">At first, it was
						cold—this was November, and to a Texas boy it felt like deep winter—but
						within a few minutes the heater was choking us and we had to ask them to
						crank it down. I put my ruck down on the floor. With my Mk-11 propped
						between my legs and my helmet on the butt, I had a makeshift pillow. I tried
						to nap as we moved. Close your eyes, and time moves faster.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I didn’t get all
						that much sleep. Every so often I glanced toward the slit windows in the
						rear door, but I couldn’t see past the guys sitting there. That wasn’t much
						of a loss—all they could see was the rest of the procession, a haze of dust,
						and a few patches of empty desert. We’d been practicing with the Marines for
						about a week, going over everything from getting in and out of their
						vehicles to figuring out exactly what sort of charges we would use to blow
						sniper holes through buildings. In between we’d worked on radio coms and
						general strategy, exchanged ideas about how to provide the best cover for
						the squads we’d be accompanying, and made a dozen tentative tactical
						decisions, such as deciding whether it would be generally better to shoot
						from the top floor or the one right below.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Now we were ready,
						but as often happens in the military, we were in hurry-up-and-wait mode. The
						tracked vehicles drove us up north of Fallujah, then stopped.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">We sat there for
						what seemed like hours. Every muscle in my body cramped. Finally someone
						decided we could drop the ramp and stretch a bit. I unfolded myself from the

						nearby.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Finally, just
						before daybreak, we loaded back up and began trundling toward the edge of
						the city. There was maximum adrenaline inside that tin can on treads. We
						were ready to get it on.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Our destination was
						an apartment complex overlooking the northwestern corner of the city.
						Roughly eight hundred yards from the start of the city proper, the buildings
						had a perfect view of the area where our Marines were going to launch their
						assault—an excellent location for snipers. All we had to do was take
						it.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“Five minutes!”

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I hooked one arm
						through my ruck and got a good grip on my gun.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The amtrac jerked
						to a halt. The rear ramp slammed down and I leapt out with the others,
						running toward a small grove with some trees and rocks for cover. I moved
						quickly—I wasn’t afraid of getting shot as much as I was of being run over
						by one of the armada that had ferried us here. The mammoth amtracs didn’t
						look like they’d stop for anybody.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I hit the dirt, got
						the ruck next to me, and began scanning the building, watching for anything
						suspicious. I worked my eyes around the windows and the surrounding area,
						expecting all the while to be shot at. The Marines, meanwhile, poured out
						their vehicles. Besides the tracked personnel carriers there were Hummers
						and tanks and dozens of support vehicles. The Marines just kept coming,
						swarming over the complex.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">They started
						kicking in doors. I couldn’t hear much, just the loud echoes of the shotguns
						they used to blow out the locks. The Marines detained a few women who had
						been outside, but otherwise the yard around the building was
					vacant.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">My eyes never
						stopped moving. I scanned constantly, trying to find something.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Our radio guy came
						over and set up nearby. He was monitoring the Marine progress as they worked
						up through the apartment building, securing it. The few inhabitants they
						found inside had to be taken out and moved to safety. There was no
						resistance inside—if there were insurgents, they’d either gotten out when
						they saw us coming, or they pretended now that they were loyal Iraqis and

						otherwise suspicious, the head of each family was given $300 and told they

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I ran from the

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">We hadn’t seen each

						life.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">A Ranger we called
						Ranger Molloy had been shepherding our rifles and some gear with us in a
						Hummer. He came up and gave me my .300 Win Mag. The rifle’s extra distance

					from.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Running up the
						stairs, I sorted the situation out in my head. I knew what side of the
						building I wanted to be on, and roughly where I wanted to be. When I reached
						the top—I’d decided I wanted to shoot from a room rather than the roof—I
						started walking through the hall, scanning for an apartment that had the
						right view. Going inside, I looked for one with furniture I could use to set
						up.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">To me, the home I
						was in was just another part of the battlefield. The apartments and
						everything in them were just things to be used to accomplish our
						goal—clearing the city.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Snipers need to
						either lie down or sit for a long period of time, so I needed to find
						furniture that would let me do that as comfortably as possible. You also
						need something to rest your rifle on. In this case, I was going to be
						shooting out of the windows, so I needed to be elevated. As I searched
						through the apartment, I found a room that had a baby crib in it. It was a
						rare find, and one I could put to good use.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Ray and I took it
						and flipped it over. That gave us a base. Then we pulled the door of the
						room off its hinges and put it on top. We now had a stable platform to work
						on.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Most Iraqis don’t
						sleep on beds; they use bedrolls, thick mats, or blankets that are put
						directly on the floor. We found a few of them and laid them out on the door.
						That made a semi-comfortable, elevated bed to lie on while working the gun.
						A rolled mat gave us a place to rest the end of our guns on.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">We opened the
						window and were ready to shoot.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">We decided we’d

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I started rummaging
						through the complex to see if I could find any cool shit—money, guns,

						Woods golf game.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Not that I was

						city I was looking out at was brownish-yellow and gray, almost as if
						everything was shaded the light sepia of an old photograph. Many, though not
						all, of the buildings were made of bricks or covered with stucco in this
						same color. The stones and roadways were gray. A fine mist of desert dust
						seemed to hover over the houses. There were trees and other vegetation, but
						the overall landscape looked like a collection of dully painted boxes in the
						desert.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Most of the
						buildings were squat houses, two stories high, occasionally three or four.
						Minarets or prayer towers poked out of the grayness at irregular intervals.
						There were mosque domes scattered around—here a green egg flanked by a dozen
						smaller eggs, there a white turnip glinting white in the sinking
					sun.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The buildings were
						packed in tight, the streets almost geometrical in their grid pattern. There
						were walls everywhere. The city had already been at war for some time, and
						there was plenty of rubble not only around the edges but in the main
						thoroughfares. Dead ahead of me but out of view was the infamous bridge
						where the insurgents had desecrated the bodies of the Blackwater contractors
						half a year earlier. The bridge spanned the Euphrates, which flowed in an
						inverted V just south of my position.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">My immediate
						concern was a set of railroad tracks about eight hundred yards from the
						building. There was a berm and a train trestle over the highway south of me.
						To the east, on my left as I looked out the window, the train line ran to a
						switching yard and station outside the main part of the city.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The Marine assault
						would sweep across the tracks, driving down and into an area from the
						Euphrates to a highway at the eastern end of the city, marked by a
						cloverleaf. This was an area roughly three and one-third miles wide; the
						plan was to move about a mile and a half deep to Iraqi Route 10 by November
						10, a little less than three days. That might not seem like a lot—most
						Marines can probably walk that far in a half hour—but the path lay through a
						rat’s nest of booby-trapped streets and past heavily armed houses. Not only
						did the Marines expect to be fighting literally house to house and block to
						block, but they also realized that things would probably get worse as they
						went. You push the rats from one hole and they congregate in the next.
						Sooner or later, they run out of places to run.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Looking out the

						Insurgents would move into that area, trying to get into position to attack
						or maybe spy on the Marines. They were about eight hundred meters away,
						across the railroad tracks and below the berm, so probably, in their mind,
						they couldn’t be seen and were safe.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">They were badly

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I’ve already

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">But the rules of

						everyone had been able to escape, only small handfuls of innocents remained.
						The males of fighting age and sound minds within the city limits were almost

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">After the first

						none of the insurgents snuck back in behind them. The idea was to clear
						Fallujah out, block by block.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The properties in
						this part of the city, as in many Iraqi cities, were walled off from their
						neighbors by thick brick and stucco walls. There were always nooks and
						crannies for insurgents to hide in. The backyards, usually flat with hard
						dirt or even cement, were rectangular mazes. It was a dry, dusty place, even
						with the river nearby. Most of the houses didn’t have running water; the
						water supply would be on the roof.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I worked with
						Marine snipers for several days during the first week or so of that phase of
						the assault. For much of the time I was paired with two Marine snipers and a
						JTAC, a SEAL who could call in air strikes. There would also be a few
						support guys, Marines who would provide security and occasionally help out
						with different tasks. These were Marines who wanted to be snipers; after
						their deployment, they were hoping to ship out to the Marine sniper
						school.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Every morning would
						start with about twenty minutes of what we called “fires”—mortars,
						artillery, bombs, missiles, rockets—it amounted to a hell of a lot of
						ordnance being dumped on key enemy positions. The fire would take out ammo
						caches or dumps, or soften up spots where we thought we’d have a lot of
						resistance. Black funnels of smoke would rise in the distance, caches hit by
						the bombings; the ground and air would rumble with secondary
						explosions.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">At first, we were
						behind the Marine advance. But it didn’t take long before I realized we
						could do a better job by getting ahead of the squad on the ground. It gave
						us a better position, allowing us to surprise any insurgents who tried
						rallying to the ground unit.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">It also gave us a
						hell of a lot more action. So we started taking houses to use as
						hides.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Once the bottom of
						the house was cleared, I’d run up the stairs from the top floor to the roof,
						emerging in the small shack that typically sheltered the entrance to the
						roof. Sure the roof was clear, I’d move over to the wall at the edge, get my
						bearings, and set up a position. Usually there would be something on the
						roof I could use—a chair or rugs—to make things more comfortable; if not,
						there was always something downstairs. I’d switched back to the Mk-11,
						realizing that most of my shots would be relatively close, because of the
						way the city was laid out. The weapon was more convenient than the Win Mag,
						and at these ranges just as deadly.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Meanwhile, the
						Marines on the ground would work down the street, usually side to side,
						clearing the houses. Once they reached a point where we could no longer
						cover them well, we’d move up and take a new spot, and the process would
						start over again.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1 x1bm-after-txb1-override" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="initial-caps initial-caps-override">G</span><span class="no-style-override">enerally, we shot from roofs. They gave the best
						view and were often already equipped with chairs and the like. Most in the
						city were ringed by low-rise walls that provided protection when the enemy
						shot back. Plus, using the roofs allowed us to move quickly; the assault
						wouldn’t wait for us to take our time getting in position.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">If the roof was no
						good, we would shoot from the upper story, usually out of a window. Once in
						a while, we would have to blow a sniper hole in the side of a wall to set up
						a firing position. That was rare, though; we didn’t want to draw more
						attention to our position by setting off an explosion, even if it was
						relatively small. (The holes were patched after we left.)</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">One day we set up
						inside a small office building that had been vacated some time before. We
						pulled the desks back from the windows and sat deep in the room; the natural
						shadows that played on the wall outside helped hide the position.</span></p>

						and a mortar base.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">That was just one
						house on a long block. It was a nice house, in fact—it had air conditioning,
						elaborate chandeliers, and fancy Western furniture. It made a good place to
						rest while we took a break one afternoon.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The houses were all
						searched carefully, but the weapons were usually pretty easy to find. The
						Marines would go inside and see a grenade launcher propped against a china
						cabinet—with rockets stacked next to the teacups below. At one house,
						Marines found dive tanks—apparently the insurgent who had been staying at
						the house used them to sneak across the river and make an attack.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Russian equipment
						was also common. Most of it was very old—in one house there were rifle
						grenades that could have been made during World War II. We found binoculars
						with old Communist hammer-and-sickle emblems. And IEDs, including some
						cemented into walls, were everywhere.</span></p>

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Later on in the
						campaign, we took a hospital they’d been using at the outskirts of the city.
						There we found cooked spoons, drug works, and other evidence of how they
						prepared themselves. I’m not an expert, but it looked to me that they would
						cook up heroin and inject it before a battle. Other things I’ve heard said
						they would use prescription drugs and basically anything they could get to
						help get their courage up.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">You could see that
						sometimes when you shot them. Some could take several bullets without

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">All of a sudden

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Then an RPG hit the

						there.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">It hurt like hell.

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">My butt was sore

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I never found out

						never had a chance to track him down.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The other Marines
						said I saved his life. But it wasn’t just me. Getting all those guys to
						safety was a joint effort; we all worked together.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The Corps was
						grateful that I had helped rescue their people, and one of the officers put
						me in for a Silver Star.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">According to the
						story I heard, the generals sitting at their desks decided that, since no
						Marines had gotten Silver Stars during the assault, they weren’t going to
						award one to a SEAL. I got a Bronze Star with a V (for valor in combat)
						instead.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Makes me smirk just
						to think about it.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Medals are all

						politics.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">All told, I would
						end my career as a SEAL with two Silver Stars and five Bronze Medals, all
						for valor. I’m proud of my service, but I sure as hell didn’t do it for any
						medal. They don’t make me any better or less than any other guy who served.
						Medals never tell the whole story. And like I said, in the end they’ve
						become more political than accurate. I’ve seen men who deserved a lot more
						and men who deserved a lot less rewarded by higher-ups negotiating for
						whatever public cause they were working on at the time. For all these
						reasons, they are not on display at my house or in my office.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">My wife is always
						encouraging me to organize or frame the paperwork on them and display the
						medals. Political or not, she still thinks they are part of the story of my
						service.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Maybe I’ll get
						around to it someday.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">More likely, I
						won’t.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1 x1bm-after-txb1-override" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="initial-caps initial-caps-override">M</span><span class="no-style-override">y uniform was covered with so much blood from the
						assault that the Marines got one of their own for me. From that point on, I
						looked like a Marine in digi cami.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">It was a little
						weird to be wearing someone else’s uniform. But it was also an honor to be
						considered a member of the team to the point where they’d outfit me. Even
						better, they gave me a fleece jacket and a fleece beanie—it was cold out
						there.</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-au" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="bold">Taya:</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">After
						one deployment, we were driving in the car and Chris said, just out of the
						blue, “Did you know there is a certain kind of smell when someone dies in a
						particular way?”</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">And I
						said, “No. I didn’t know that.”</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">And
						gradually I got the story.</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">It was
						suitably gruesome.</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">Stories
						would just come out. A lot of times, he said things to see what I could
						handle. I told him I really, truly did not care what he did in wartime. He
						had my unconditional support. Still, he needed to go slow, to test the
						waters. I think he needed to know I wouldn’t look at him differently, and
						perhaps more than that, he knew he would deploy again and he didn’t want to
						scare me.</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">As far
						as I can see it, anyone who has a problem with what guys do over there is
						incapable of empathy. People want America to have a certain image when we
						fight. Yet I would guess if someone were shooting at them and they had to
						hold their family members while they bled out against an enemy who hid
						behind their children, played dead only to throw a grenade as they got
						closer, and who had no qualms about sending their toddler to die from a
						grenade from which they personally pulled the pin—they would be less
						concerned with playing nicely.</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">Chris
						followed the ROEs because he had to. Some of the more broad-spectrum ROEs
						are fine. The problem with the ROEs covering minutiae is that terrorists
						really don’t give a shit about the Geneva Convention. So picking apart a
						soldier’s every move against a dark, twisted, rule-free enemy is more than
						ridiculous; it’s despicable.</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">I care
						about my husband and other Americans coming home alive. So other than being
						concerned for his safety, I truly wasn’t afraid to hear anything he wanted
						to share. Even before I heard the stories, I don’t think I was ever under
						illusions that war is pretty or nice.</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">When he
						told me the story about killing someone up close, all I thought was, Thank
						God he’s okay.</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">Then I
						thought, You’re kind of a bad-ass. Wow.</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">Mostly,
						we didn’t talk about killing, or the war. But then it would
					intrude.</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">Not
						always in a bad way: one day, Chris was getting his oil changed at a local
						shop. Some men were in the lobby with him. The guy behind the counter called
						Chris’s name. Chris paid his bill and sat back down.</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">One of
						the guys waiting for his own vehicle looked at him and said, “Are you Chris
						Kyle?”</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">And
						Chris said, “Yeah.”</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">“Were
						you in Fallujah?”</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">“Yeah.”</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">“Holy
						shit, you’re the guy who saved our ass.”</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">The
						guy’s father was there and he came over to thank Chris and shake his hand.
						They were all saying, “You were great. You got more kills than
						anyone.”</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">Chris
						got embarrassed and very humbly said, “Y’all saved my ass, too.”</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-last" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">And
						that was it.</span></p>

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">And with that, I

				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1 x1bm-after-txb1-override" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="initial-caps initial-caps-override">O</span><span class="no-style-override">ver the past few days, the insurgents had stopped
						coming out to fight us. Our kill rate from the overwatches had declined. The
						bad guys were all staying inside, because they knew if they came outside, we
						were going to shoot them.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">They didn’t give
						up. Instead, they would take their stands inside the houses, ambushing and
						battling the Marines in the small rooms and tiny hallways. I was seeing a
						lot of our guys being carried out and medevac’d.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I’d been turning
						the idea of going down on the street over in my head for a while, before

						potential.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Part of the reason
						I went down on the streets was because I was bored. The bigger part was that
						I felt I could do a better job protecting the Marines if I was with them.
						They were going in the front door of these buildings and getting whacked.
						I’d watch as they went in, hear gunshots, and then the next thing I knew,
						they’d be hauling someone out in a stretcher because he just got shot up. It
						pissed me off.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I love the Marines,
						but the truth is these guys had never been taught to do room clearances like
						I had. It’s not a Marine specialty. They were all tough fighters, but they
						had a lot to learn about urban warfare. Much was simple stuff: how to hold
						your rifle as you come into a room so it’s hard for someone else to grab;
						where to move as you enter the room; how to fight 360 degrees in a
						city—things that SEALs learn so well we can do them in our sleep.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The squad didn’t
						have an officer; the highest-ranking NCO was a staff sergeant, an E6 in the
						Marine Corps. I was an E5, junior to him, but he didn’t have a problem
						letting me take control of the takedowns. We’d already been working together
						for a while, and I think I’d won a certain amount of respect. Plus, he
						didn’t want his guys getting shot up, either.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“Look, I’m a SEAL,
						you’re Marines,” I told the boys. “I’m no better than you are. The only
						difference between you and me is I’ve spent more time specializing and
						training in this than you did. Let me help you.”</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">We trained a little
						bit during the break. I gave some of my explosives to one of the squad
						members with experience in explosives. We did a little run-through on how to
						blow locks off. Until that point, they’d had such a small amount of
						explosives that they’d mostly been knocking the doors in, which, of course,
						took time and made them more vulnerable.</span></p>

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">It was hard to get

						definitely right—what I felt I </span><span class="italic italic-override">had</span><span class="no-style-override"> to do—but it would severely piss

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">But that would be

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“Let’s do it,” I

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">We blew the door

						room, stepped to the side, and started directing traffic. The pace was

						anymore. I didn’t think about anything except the door, the house, the

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">A Marine armored

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Knowing that we
						considered cemeteries sacred, the insurgents typically used them to hide
						caches of weapons and explosives. At one point, we were in a hide
						overlooking the walled-in boundaries of a large cemetery that sat in the

						fields wide, it was a cement city of the dead, filled with tombstones and
						mausoleums. We set up on a roof near a prayer tower and mosque overlooking
						the cemetery.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The roof we were on
						was fairly elaborate. It was ringed with a brick wall punctuated with iron
						grates, giving us excellent firing positions; I sat down on my haunches and
						spotted in my rifle through a gap in the grid work, studying the paths
						between the stones a few hundred yards out. There was so much dust and grit
						in the air, I kept my goggles on. I’d also learned in Fallujah to keep my
						helmet cinched tight, wary of the chips and cement frags that flew from the
						battered masonry during a firefight.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I picked out some

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Within seconds, we
						were fully engaged in a firefight. Insurgents kept popping up from behind
						the stones—I don’t know if there was a tunnel or where they came from. Brass
						flew from the 60 nearby.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I studied my shots
						as the Marines around me poured out fire. Everything they did faded into the
						background as I carefully put my scope on a target, steadied the aim on
						center mass, then squeezed ever so smoothly. When the bullet leapt from the
						barrel, it was almost a surprise.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">My target fell. I

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Until, finally,
						there were no more. I got up and moved a few feet to a spot where the wall
						completely shielded me from the cemetery. There I took my helmet off and

						shells—hundreds if not thousands.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Someone shared a
						large plastic bottle of water. One of the Marines pulled his ruck over and
						used it as a pillow, catching some sleep. Another went downstairs, to the

						with cartons of flavored cigarettes. He lit a few, and a cherry scent
						mingled with the heavy stench that always hung over Iraq, a smell of sewage
						and sweat and death.</span></p>

						level was filled with shops. Each of their awnings were covered with a thick
						layer of dust and grit, turning the bright colors of the fabric into a hazy
						blur. Metal shields blocked most of the storefronts; they were pockmarked

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">One of our com guys

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I have to say that
						all of the pilots we had overhead were pretty accurate. In a lot of
						situations, we were asking for bombs and missiles to hit within a few

						or more pounds of destruction. But we didn’t have any incidents, and I was

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">While, ordinarily,
						anything connected to a mosque would have been out of bounds, the sniper’s
						presence made it a legitimate target. We called an air strike on the tower,
						which had a high, windowed dome at the top, with two sets of walkways
						running around it that made it look a little like an air traffic control
						tower. The roof was made of panels of glass, topped by a spiked
					pole.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">We hunkered down as
						the aircraft came in. The bomb flew through the sky, hit the top of the
						minaret, and went straight through one of the large panes at the top. It
						then continued down into a yard across the alley. There it went
						low-order—exploding without much visible impact.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“Shit,” I said. “He

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">We ran down a few

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">No one did. When we

						marsh across the river as cover. The river coast was dotted with countless
						little islands with trees and brush. Here and there an old foundation or a
						pile of dredged dirt and rock poked up between the bushes.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Insurgents would
						pop up from the vegetation, take their shots, then squirrel back into the
						brush where you couldn’t see them. The vegetation was so thick they could
						get pretty close not just to the river but to us—often within a hundred
						yards without being seen. Even the Iraqis could hit something from that
						distance.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Making things even

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">We tried getting
						creative, requesting a napalm hit on the marsh to burn down the
						vegetation.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">That idea was
						vetoed.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">As the nights went

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Not that I wouldn’t

						controller), to call in air support against the insurgents. The fellow they
						sent over was a Marine aviator, a pilot, working on a ground rotation. He
						tried a few times to vector in air attacks, but the requests were always
						denied higher up the chain of command.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">At the time, I was
						told that there had been so much devastation in the city that they didn’t
						want any more collateral damage. I don’t see how blowing up a bunch of weeds
						and muck would make Fallujah look any worse than it already did, but then
						I’m just a SEAL and obviously don’t understand those sorts of complicated
						issues.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Anyway, the pilot
						himself was a good guy. He didn’t act stuck up or high and mighty; you’d
						never know he was an officer. We all liked him and respected him. And just
						to show there were no hard feelings, we let him get on the rifle every so
						often and look around. He never got off any shots.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Besides the FAC,
						the Marines sent a heavy-weapons squad, more snipers, and then mortarmen.
						The mortarmen brought some white phosphorous shells with them, and they
						tried launching those in an attempt to burn down the brush. Unfortunately,
						the shells would only set small pieces of the marsh on fire—they’d burn a
						bit, then fizzle and go out because it was so wet.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Our next try was
						throwing thermite grenades. A thermite grenade is an incendiary device that
						burns at four thousand degrees Fahrenheit and can go through a quarter-inch
						of steel in a few seconds. We went down to the river and hauled them
						across.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">That didn’t work,
						either, so we started making our own homegrown concoctions. Between the
						Marine sniper detail and the mortarmen, there was a great deal of creative
						brainpower focused on that marsh. Of all the plans, one of my personal
						favorites involved the creative use of the shaped “cheese” charges the
						mortarmen typically carried. (The cheese is used to propel mortar rounds.
						Distance can be adjusted by varying the amount of cheese used to fire the
						projectile.) We’d shove some cheese in a tube, add a bunch of det cord, some
						diesel, and add a time fuse. Then we’d heave the contraption across the
						river and see what happened.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">We got some pretty

						there, knowing that we wouldn’t shoot them, because they were so far away.
						Our ROEs allowed us to take them, but the distance was so great that it

						safe, they began mocking us like a bunch of juvenile delinquents.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The FAC came over

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Well, I didn’t say

						it, but it seemed my ninja smoke had run out. I left and went over to the
						other side of the city and the Green Zone. (The Green Zone was a section of
						central Baghdad that was created as a safe area for the allies and the new
						Iraqi government. It was physically cut off from the rest of the city by
						cement walls and barbed wire. There were only a few ways in and out, and
						these were under strict control. The U.S. and other allied embassies were
						located there, as were Iraqi government buildings.)</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I lasted an entire

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The Iraqi
						officials, so-called, were notorious for not telling their escorts what

						significant problem.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I acted as
						“advance.” That meant I would go ahead of an official convoy, make sure the
						route was safe, and then stand at the security checkpoint and ID the convoy
						vehicles as they came through. This way the Iraqi vehicles could move
						through the checkpoints quickly without becoming targets.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">One day, I was

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Baghdad
						International was on the other side of the city from the Green Zone. While
						the grounds themselves were secure, the area around it and the highway
						leading to the gate still came under occasional fire. It was a prime terror

						or out was related to the Americans or the new Iraqi government in some
						way.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I was on radio coms

						could pass along to the guards.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The convoy came

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Behind me, the

						with civilians to make it more difficult for us to figure out who they were.

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Habbaniyah turned

				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">“It

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Once the camp was

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">We’d take pictures

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Most of these ops

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Now, from our

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I guess you can

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">But some cases
						didn’t go so smoothly. We began realizing that if we didn’t have a photo,

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">It sucked for the

						fire.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">A few minutes

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I had already told

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">A tank commander

						gone.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The tank commander

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“Yes, yes,” said

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Now, I was two

						she thought would give me grief.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">We were recalled to

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The colonel wanted

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">We were all pissed.

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I had trouble

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Well, after three

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“Any time I shoot

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">They’d all been

						but it was big to me.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Now that I was

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The combination

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">One day, those

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“What! Are you

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I did do some

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">We tested him,
						believe me. We’d find the biggest man in the platoon and make him carry him.
						He did it. We’d have him take the hardest jobs in training; he did them
						without complaint. And he’d crack us up in the process. He had these great
						facial expressions. He could point his upper lip, screw his eyes around and
						then twist in a certain way, and you’d lose it.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Naturally, this
						ability led to a certain amount of fun. For us, at least.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">One time we told
						him to go do the face to our chief.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“B-but
						.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” he stammered.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“Do it,” I told
						him. “Go get in his face. You’re the new guy. Do it.”</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">He did. Thinking
						Ryan was trying to be a jerk, the chief grabbed him by the throat and tossed
						him to the ground.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">That only
						encouraged us. Ryan had to show the face a lot. Every time, he’d go and get
						his ass beat. Finally, we had him do it to one of our officers—a huge guy,
						definitely not someone to be messed with, even by another SEAL.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“Go do it to him,”
						one of us said.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“Oh God, no,” he
						protested.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“If you don’t do it
						right now, we’re going to choke you out,” I warned.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“Can you please
						just choke me out right now?”</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“Go do it,” we all
						said.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">He went and did it
						to the officer. He reacted about how you would expect. After a little while,
						Ryan tried to tap out.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“There’s no tapping
						out,” he snarled, continuing his pounding.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Ryan survived, but
						that was the last time we made him do the face.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1 x1bm-after-txb1-override" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="initial-caps initial-caps-override">E</span><span class="no-style-override">verybody got hazed when they joined the platoon.

						enlisted men.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">At the time, new
						guys didn’t receive their Tridents—and thus weren’t really SEALs—until after
						they had passed a series of tests with the team. We had our own little
						ritual that involved a mock boxing match against their whole platoon. Each
						new guy had to get through three rounds—once you’re knocked down, that’s a
						round—before being formally pinned and welcomed to the
					brotherhood.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I was Ryan’s safety
						officer, making sure he didn’t get too busted up. He had a head guard and
						everyone wore boxing gloves, but the hazing can get kind of enthusiastic,
						and the safety officer is there to make sure it doesn’t get out of
						hand.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Ryan wasn’t
						satisfied with three rounds. He wanted more. I think he thought if he fought
						long enough, he’d beat them all.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Not that he lasted
						too much longer. I had warned him that I was his safety and whatever he did,
						he was not to hit me. In the confusion of his head being bounced off the
						platoon’s gloves, he swung and hit me.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I did what I had to

						another unit to help round us out. He immediately fit in.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Marc was an
						athletic guy, in some ways exactly the sort of tough physical specimen you
						expect to be a SEAL. Before joining the Navy, he had played soccer well
						enough to be given a tryout with a professional team, and may very well have
						been a pro if a leg injury hadn’t cut short his career.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">But there was a lot
						more to Marc than just physical prowess. He’d studied for the ministry, and
						while he left because of what he saw as hypocrisy among the seminary
						students, he was still very religious. Later on during our deployment, he
						led a small group in prayer before every op. As you’d expect, he was very
						knowledgeable about the Bible and religion in general. He didn’t push it on
						you, but if you needed or wanted to talk about faith or God, he was always
						willing.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Not that he was a
						saint, or even above the horseplay that is part of being a SEAL.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Soon after he
						joined us, we went on a training mission in Nevada. At the end of the day, a
						group of us piled into a four-door truck and headed back to the base to get
						to bed. Marc was in the back with me and a SEAL we’ll call Bob. For some
						reason, Bob and I started talking about being choked out.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">With new-guy
						enthusiasm—and maybe naiveté—Marc said, “I’ve never been choked
					out.”</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“ ’Scuse me?” I
						said, leaning over to get a good look at this virgin. Being choked out is a
						mandatory SEAL occupation.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Marc looked at me.
						I looked at him.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“Bring it on,” he
						said.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">As Bob leaned over,
						I dove and choked Marc out. My work completed, I leaned back.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“You mother,” said
						Bob, straightening. “I wanted to do it.”</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“I thought you were

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“Hell no. I was

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“Well, okay,” I
						said. “He’ll wake up, then you get him.”</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">He did. I think
						half the platoon had a shot at him before the night was out. Marc took it

						us back in training, and, in fact, approved extra training for
						snipers.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">My command master
						chief, whom I’ll call Primo, was another top-notch commander. He didn’t give
						a flying fuck about promotions, about looking good, or covering his butt: he
						was all about successful missions and getting the job done. And he was a
						Texan—as you can tell, I’m a little partial—which meant he was a
						bad-ass.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">His briefs always

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Primo was all about

						to do it.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">He was also a good

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">You always have

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“Listen, I know
						you’re going to get into fights,” he told us. “So here’s what you do. You

						Because when you get caught is when I have to get involved.”</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I took that advice

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Maybe because he

						when I may have told off an officer or two; Chief Primo took care of it. He
						might chew me out himself, but he always smoothed the way with head shed. On
						the other side of things, he knew he could count on Pepper and me to get a

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">On the front of my

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Because of the

						leaving the States about a week behind the rest of my platoon. By the time I
						landed in Baghdad in April 2006, my platoon had been sent west to the area
						of Ramadi. No one in Baghdad seemed to know how to get me out there. It was
						up to me to get over to my boys.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">A direct flight to
						Ramadi was impossible—things were too hot there. So I had to cobble together

						at Baghdad International Airport.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">At some point, I
						overheard an officer talking about problems the Army was having with some

						onto the helicopter.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">A colonel stopped

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“Helicopter’s

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">But I had an idea.
						I led the Ranger to the base hospital, and found a corpsman. I’ve worked

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I took a SEAL

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Even if the guys

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">But one of the best

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">It was a big, goofy

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">He mentioned it one

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Our comms guy

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">SEALs usually do

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I was the point

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">One night not long

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I played the light

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">But since I’d been

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">But I couldn’t find

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Don’t get the wrong

						concrete building had been started and then abandoned a few years before.
						The Army wanted to finish it for the Iraqis; decent medical care was a big
						need out there. But they couldn’t get close to it to do any work, because as
						soon as they did, they came under fire. So we went to work.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Our platoon,
						sixteen guys, teamed up with about twenty soldiers to clear the nearby
						village of insurgents. Entering town early one morning, we split up and
						started taking houses.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I was at point,
						carrying my Mk-12, the first guy in each building. Once the house was
						secure, I’d go up to the roof, cover the guys on the ground, and look for
						insurgents, who we expected to attack once they knew we were there. The
						group leapfrogged forward, clearing the area as we went.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Unlike in the city,
						these houses weren’t right next to each other, so the process took longer
						and was more spread-out. But soon enough, the terrorists realized where we
						were and what we were up to, and they put together a little attack from a
						mosque. Holed up behind its walls, they started raining AK fire at a squad
						of soldiers on the ground.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I was up on one of
						the roofs when the fight started. Within moments, we started firing
						everything we had at the bad guys: M-4s, M-60s, sniper rifles, 40-mm
						grenades, LAW rockets—everything we had. We lit that mosque up.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The momentum of the
						battle quickly shifted in our favor. The soldiers on the ground began
						maneuvering to assault the mosque, hoping to catch the insurgents before
						they could slide back into whatever sewer they’d emerged from. We shifted
						our fire higher, moving our aim above their heads to allow them to get
						in.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Somewhere in the
						middle of the fight, a piece of hot brass from another gun—probably an M-60
						machine gun next to me—shot against my leg and landed in my boots next to my
						ankle. It burned like hell, but I couldn’t do anything about it—there were
						too many bad guys popping up from behind the walls, trying to get my
						people.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I was wearing
						simple hiking boots rather than combat boots. That was my normal style—they
						were lighter and more comfortable, and ordinarily more than enough to
						protect my feet. Unfortunately, I hadn’t bothered to lace them up very well

						the brass happened to fall after it ejected.</span></p>

						And usually we did.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Pushed from the
						village and the mosque, the insurgents retreated to the hospital. They loved
						hospital buildings, not only because they were big and usually well-made

						attack hospitals, even after they were taken over by terrorists.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">It took a while,

						met with a lot of force, however, you could count on about half squirting

						the first time we used it against a building. Once word spread, of course,
						everyone wanted to use them.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Technically, the
						Carl Gustav was developed to combat armor, but as we found out, it was
						pretty potent against buildings. In fact, it was perfect in Ramadi—it just
						blew right through reinforced concrete and took out whoever was inside. The
						overpressure from the explosion wiped out the interior.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">We had different
						rounds for the gun. (Remember, it’s actually considered a recoilless rifle
						rather than a rocket launcher.) A lot of times, the insurgents would hide
						behind embankments and other barriers, well protected. In that case, you
						could set an air-burst round to explode over them. The air burst was a lot
						worse than anything that detonated on the ground.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The Gustav is
						relatively easy to use. You have to wear double ear-protection and be

						done; it wasn’t a reloadable weapon. The Carl Gustav was always a big
						hit—pun intended.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Another weapon we
						used quite a bit was the 40-mm grenade launcher. The launcher comes in two

						stand-alone weapon. We had both.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Our standard
						grenade was a “frag”—a grenade that exploded and sprayed an area with
						shrapnel or fragments. This is a traditional antipersonnel weapon, tried and
						true.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">While we were on
						this deployment, we received a new type of projectile using a thermobaric
						explosive. Those had a lot more “boom”—a single grenade launched at an enemy
						sniper in a small structure could bring the whole building down because of
						the over-pressure created by the explosion. Most times, of course, we were
						firing at a larger building, but the destructive power was still intense.
						You’d have a violent explosion, a fire, and then no more enemy. Gotta love
						it.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">You shoot grenades
						with what we call Kentucky windage—estimating the distance, adjusting the
						elevation of the launcher, and firing. We liked the M-79—the standalone
						version that was first used during the Vietnam War—because it had sights,
						making it a bit easier to aim and hit what you wanted. But one way or
						another, you quickly got the hang of things, because you were using the

						ambushes on convoys and American bases.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">It’s true that it
						can be difficult to sort out civilians from insurgents in certain
						situations, but here the bad guys made it easy for us. UAVs would watch a
						road, for example, and when they saw someone planting a bomb, they could not
						only pinpoint the booby-trap but follow the insurgent back to his house.
						That gave us excellent intel on where the bad guys were.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Terrorists going to
						attack Americans would give themselves away by moving tactically against
						approaching convoys or when coming close to a base. They’d sneak around with
						their AKs ready—it was very easy to spot them.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">They also learned
						to spot us. If we took over a house in a small hamlet, we would keep the
						family inside for safety. The people who lived nearby would know that if the
						family wasn’t outside by nine o’clock in the morning, there were Americans
						inside. That was an open invitation for any insurgent in the area to come
						and try to kill us.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">It became so
						predictable, it seemed to happen according to a time schedule. Around about
						nine in the morning you’d have a firefight; things would slack off around
						midday. Then, around three or four in the afternoon, you’d have another. If
						the stakes weren’t life and death, it would have been funny.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">And at the time, it

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">You didn’t know
						which direction they’d attack from, but the tactics were almost always the
						same. The insurgents would start out with automatic fire, pop off a bit
						here, pop off there. Then you’d get the RPGs, a flurry of fire; finally,
						they’d scatter and try to get away.</span></p>

						with in the States.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">They fit in a

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Because they flew
						low and had relatively loud little engines, the backpack UAVs could be heard
						on the ground. They had a distinctive whine, and the Iraqis soon learned

				<p class="x1bm-after-a" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="initial-caps initial-caps-override">B</span><span class="no-style-override">y early June, the Army had come up with a plan to
						take Ramadi back from the insurgents. In Fallujah, the Marines had worked
						systematically through the city, chasing and then pushing the insurgents
						out. Here, the insurgents were going to come to us.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The city itself was
						wedged between waterways and swampland. There was limited access by road.
						The Euphrates and the Habbaniyah canal bounded the city on the north and
						west; there was one bridge on either side near the northwestern tip. To the
						south and east, a lake, swamps, and a seasonal drainage canal helped form a
						natural barrier to the countryside.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The U.S. forces
						would come in from the perimeters of the city, the Marines from up north,
						and the Army on the other three sides. We would establish strongholds in
						various parts of the city, demonstrating that we were in control—and
						essentially daring the enemy to attack. When they did attack, we would fight
						back with everything we had. We’d set up more and more footholds, gradually
						extending control over the entire city.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The place was a
						mess. There was no functioning government, and it was beyond lawless.
						Foreigners entering the city were instant targets for killing or kidnapping,
						even if they were in armored convoys. But the place was a worse hell for
						ordinary Iraqis. Reports have estimated that there were more than twenty
						insurgent attacks against Iraqis every day. The easiest way to be killed in
						the city was to join the police force. Meanwhile, corruption was
						rife.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The Army analyzed
						the terrorist groups in the city and decided there were three different
						categories: hard-core Islamist fanatics, associated with al-Qaeda and
						similar groups; locals who were a little less fanatic though they still
						wanted to kill Americans; and opportunistic criminal gangs who were
						basically trying to make a living off the chaos.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The first group had
						to be eliminated because they would never give up; they would be our main
						focus in the coming campaign. The other two groups, though, might be
						persuaded to either leave, quit killing people, or work with the local
						tribal leadership. So, part of the Army plan would be to work with the
						tribal leadership to bring peace to the area. By all accounts, they had
						grown tired of the insurgents and the chaos they had brought, and wanted
						them gone.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The situation and
						plan were a lot more complicated than I can sum up. But to us on the ground,
						all of this was irrelevant. We didn’t give a damn about the nuances. What we

						necessarily desirable) took them with us on operations. We worked with three
						different groups; we called them all </span><span class="italic italic-override">jundi</span><span class="no-style-override">s, Arabic for soldiers, although, technically, some were police. No matter
						which force they were with, they were pathetic.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">We had used a small
						group of scouts during our operations east of the city. When we went into
						Ramadi, we used SMPs—they were a type of special police. And then we had a
						third group of Iraqi soldiers that we used in villages outside of the city.
						During most operations, we would put them in the middle of our
						columns—Americans at the front, the Iraqis in the center, Americans at the
						rear. If we were inside a house, they would sit on the first floor, doing

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I realize that a

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The Marines slid
						back into the water and were gone.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Taking point, I
						started moving up the street toward our target. Small houses loomed ahead;
						there were alleys and wider roads, a maze of buildings, and the shadows of
						larger structures.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I hadn’t gotten
						very far when the laser on my rifle crapped out. The battery had died. I
						halted our advance.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“What the hell’s
						going on?” asked my lieutenant, coming up quickly.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“I need to change

						aiming blind—little better than not aiming at all.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“No, get us out of

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“All
					right.”</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">So I started
						walking again, taking us up to a nearby intersection. A figure appeared in
						the darkness ahead, along the edge of a shallow drainage canal. I caught the
						shadow of his weapon, stared for a moment as I made out the details—AK-47,
						extra mag taped to one in the rifle.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Muj.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The enemy. His back
						was turned and he was watching the street rather than the water, but he was
						well-armed and ready for a fight.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Without the laser,
						I would have been shooting blind. I motioned to my lieutenant. He came up
						quick, right behind me, and—</span><span class="italic italic-override">boom</span><span class="no-style-override">.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">He took down the
						insurgent. He also damn near put a hole in my eardrum, blasting a few inches
						from my head.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">There was no time
						to bitch. I ran forward as the Iraqi fell, unsure whether he was dead or if
						there were others nearby. The entire platoon followed, spreading out and
						“busting” the corners.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The guy was dead. I
						grabbed his AK. We ran up the street to the house we were going to take,
						passing some smaller houses on the way. We were a few hundred yards from the
						river, just off two main roads that would control that corner of the
						city.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Like many Iraqi
						houses, our target had a wall around it approximately six feet tall. The
						gate was locked, so I slung my M-4 on my shoulder, took out my pistol, and
						hauled up onto the wall, climbing up with one hand free.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">When I got to the
						top, I saw there were people sleeping in the courtyard. I dropped down
						inside their compound, holding my gun on them, expecting one of my platoon
						mates to come over after me to open the gate.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I
					waited.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">And waited. And
						waited.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“Come on,” I
						hissed. “Get over here.”</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Nothing.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">“Come
						on!”</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Some of the Iraqis
						started to stir.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I eased toward the
						gate, knowing I was all alone. Here I was, holding a pistol on a dozen
						insurgents for all I knew, and separated from the rest of my boys by a thick
						wall and locked gate.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I found the gate
						and managed to jimmy it open. The platoon and our Iraqi </span><span class="italic italic-override">jundi</span><span class="no-style-override">s
						ran in, surrounding the people who’d been sleeping in the courtyard.
						(There’d been a mix-up outside, and for some reason they hadn’t realized I
						was in there alone.)</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The people sleeping
						in the courtyard turned out to be just a regular extended family. Some of my
						guys got them situated without firing any shots, rounding them up and moving
						them to a safe area. Meanwhile, the rest of us ran in to the buildings,
						clearing each room as quickly as we could. There was a main building, and
						then a smaller cottage nearby. While my boys checked for weapons and bombs,
						anything suspicious, I raced to the rooftop.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">One of the reasons
						we’d selected the building was its height—the main structure was three
						stories tall, and so I had a decent view of the surrounding area.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Nothing stirred. So

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“Building secure,”

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I had mixed
						feelings. On the one hand, I had experience and knowledge to add something
						useful. On the other hand, it got me doing the kind of work I don’t like to
						do. It seemed a little “admin” or bureaucratic—coat-and-tie stuff, to use a

						platoon. Usually you have a chief petty officer (E7), who’s the senior
						enlisted guy, and an LPO, the lead petty officer. Generally the LPO is an
						E6, and the only one in the platoon. In our platoon, we had two. I was the
						junior E6, which was great—Jay, the other E6, was LPO, and so I missed a lot
						of the admin duties that go with that post. On the other hand, I had the
						benefits of the rank. For me, it was kind of like the story of Goldilocks
						and the Three Bears—I was too senior to do the bullshit jobs and too junior
						to do the political jobs. I was just right.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I hated sitting
						down at a computer and mapping everything out, let alone making a slideshow
						presentation out of it. I would have much rather just said, “Hey, follow me;
						I’ll show what we’re going to do on the fly.” But writing it all down was
						important: if I went down, someone else would have to be able to step in and
						know what was going on.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I did get stuck
						with one admin job that had nothing to do with mission planning: evaluating
						the E5s. I truly hated it. (Jay arranged some sort of trip and left me with
						that—I’m sure because he didn’t want to do it, either.) The bright side was
						that I realized how good our people were. There were absolutely no turds in
						that platoon—it was a real outstanding group.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1 x1bm-after-txb1-override" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="initial-caps initial-caps-override">A</span><span class="no-style-override">side from my rank and experience, the head shed
						wanted me involved in planning, because snipers were taking a more
						aggressive role in battle. We had become, in military terms, a force
						multiplier, able to do a lot more than you might think based on our sheer
						numbers alone.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Most planning
						decisions involved details like the best houses to take for overwatch, the
						route to take in, how we’d be dropped off, what we would do after the
						initial houses were taken, etc. Some of the decisions could be very subtle.
						How you get to a sniper hide, for example. The preference would be to get
						there as stealthily as possible. That might suggest walking in, as we had in
						some of the villages. But you don’t want to walk through narrow alleys where
						there’s a lot of trash—too much noise, too many chances for an IED or an
						ambush.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">There’s a
						misperception among the general public that SpecOp troops always parachute
						or fast-rope into a trouble zone. While we certainly do both where
						appropriate, we didn’t fly into any of the areas in Ramadi. Helicopters do
						have certain advantages, speed and the ability to travel relatively long
						distances being one of them. But they’re also loud and attract attention in
						an urban environment. And they’re relatively easy targets to shoot
						down.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">In this case,
						coming in by water made a great deal of sense, because of the way Ramadi is
						laid out and where the target was located. It allowed us to get to a spot
						near the target area stealthily, comparatively quickly, and with less chance
						of contact than the overland routes. But that decision led to an unexpected
						problem—we had no boats.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1 x1bm-after-txb1-override" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="initial-caps initial-caps-override">O</span><span class="no-style-override">rdinarily, SEALs work with Special Boat Teams,
						known at the time and in the past as Special Boat Units, or SBUs. Same
						mission, different name. They drive the fast boats that insert SEALs and
						then retrieve them; we were rescued by one when we were “lost” on the
						California coast during training.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">There was a bit of
						friction between SEALs and SBUs back home in the bars, where you’d
						occasionally hear some SBU members claiming to be SEALs. Team guys would
						think, and sometimes say, that’s like a taxi driver claiming to be a movie
						star because he drove someone to the studio.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Whatever. There are
						some damn good guys out there. The last thing we need is to be picking
						fights with the people who are supporting us.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">But that’s a point
						that works both ways. Our problem in Ramadi came from the fact the unit that
						was supposed to be working with us refused to help.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">They told us they
						were too important to be working with us. In fact, they claimed to be

						needed. Which they weren’t.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Hey, sorry. I’m
						pretty sure their job was to help whoever needed it, but whatever. We hunted
						around and found a Marine unit that was equipped with SURC boats—small,
						shallow-draft vessels that could get right up to the shore. They were
						armored and equipped with machine guns fore and aft.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The guys driving

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">They knew their

						The house we were on was at the corner of a T-intersection of two major
						roads, one of which we called Sunset. The Army wanted the spot because of
						its strategic location; it was a choke point and a pretty clear presence
						inside the city.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Those factors also
						made it a prime target.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The tanks drew
						attention right away. A couple of insurgents began moving toward the house
						as they arrived. The bad guys were armed with AKs, maybe foolishly thinking
						they could scare the armor off. I waited until they were two hundred yards
						from the tanks before picking them off. They were easy shots, nailed before
						they could coordinate an organized attack.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1 x1bm-after-txb1-override" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="initial-caps initial-caps-override">A</span><span class="no-style-override"> few hours passed. I kept finding shots—the

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The Army commander

						is a hard-hitter at that range.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">While it was still

						but on the rest of the area. We called it Four Story; it would end up being
						a home away from home for much of the battle that followed.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">We got in without

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">They targeted COP
						Falcon, but ineptly. They’d walk, drive, ride mopeds, trying to get close
						enough to launch an attack. It was always obvious what they were doing:

						second would have a grenade launcher.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I mean, come

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">We started getting
						a lot of shots. Four Story was a great sniper hide. It was the tallest
						building around, and you couldn’t get close enough to shoot at it without
						exposing yourself. It was easy to pick an attacker off. Dauber says we took
						twenty-three guys in the first twenty-four hours we were there; in the days
						that followed, we’d get plenty more targets.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Of course, after
						the first shot, it was a fighting position, not a sniper hide. But in a way,

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Very shortly after

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">There was a little
						bit of a competition between myself and some of the other snipers during
						this deployment, to see who got the most kills. Not that we had all that
						much to do with the numbers—they were more a product of how many targets we
						had to shoot at. It’s just the luck of the draw—you want to have the highest
						numbers, but there’s not much you can do about it.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I did want to be

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">A lot of these

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The place was still
						a hellhole, extremely dangerous. But there were signs of progress. The
						tribal leaders were more vocal about wanting peace, and more began working

						keeping order, naturally. But there were large sections of the city under
						relative control.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The “inkblot

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Progress was never

						for a while, then we’d have to start all over again.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">We worked a bit
						more with the Marines as well, stopping and inspecting small craft, going
						after a suspected weapons cache, and even running a few DAs for them. A few

						they couldn’t be used for smuggling.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Funny thing: the
						SBU unit that had blown us off earlier heard about how much action we were

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Meanwhile, the Army

						building with a good view of one of the major east-west roads through the
						center of Ramadi. It was four stories high, the staircase lined with
						windows, the roof open and with a good view of the area. It was a clear
						day.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Ryan was joking
						with me as we went in. He was cracking me up—he always made me laugh, made
						me relax. Smiling, I posted him to watch the road. Our troops were working
						on a side street on the other side of the roof, and I figured that if the
						insurgents were going to launch an ambush or try and attack us, they would
						come down that road. Meanwhile, I watched the team on the ground. The
						assault began smoothly, with the soldiers taking first one house and then
						another. They moved quickly, without a snag.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Suddenly, shots
						flew through our position. I ducked down as a round hit the cement nearby,
						splattering chips everywhere. This was an everyday occurrence in Ramadi,
						something that happened not once a day but several times.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I waited a second
						to make sure the insurgents were done firing, then got back up.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“You guys all
						right?” I yelled, looking down the street toward the soldiers on the ground,
						making sure they were okay.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“Yeah,” grunted the
						other sniper.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Ryan didn’t answer.
						I glanced back and saw him, still down.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“Hey, get up,” I

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">He didn’t move. I

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“What the hell?” I

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Then I saw the

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I knelt down and

						smashed in. He’d taken a bullet.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">We had pounded into
						him the fact that you have to always have your weapon up and ready; he’d had
						it up and scanning when the bullet hit. It apparently got the rifle first,
						then ricocheted into his face.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I grabbed the
						radio. “Man down!” I yelled. “Man down!”</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I dropped back and
						examined his wounds. I didn’t know what to do, where to start. Ryan looked
						as if he’d been hit so bad that he was going to die.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">His body shook. I
						thought it was a death spasm.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Two of our platoon
						guys, Dauber and Tommy, ran up. They were both corpsmen. They slipped down
						between us and started treating him.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Marc Lee came up
						behind them. He took the 60 and began laying down fire in the direction the
						shots had come from, chasing the insurgents back so we could carry Ryan down
						the stairs.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I picked him up and
						held him up over my shoulder, then started to run. I reached the stairs and
						started going down quickly.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">About halfway, he
						started groaning loudly. The way I was holding him, the blood had rushed
						into his throat and head; he was having trouble breathing.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I set him down,
						even more worried, knowing in my heart he was going to die, hoping that
						somehow, some way, I might do something to keep him going, even though it
						was hopeless.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Ryan began spitting
						blood. He caught his breath—he was breathing, a miracle in
					itself.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I reached out to
						grab him and pick him up again.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“No,” he said. “No,
						no I’m good. I got this. I’m walking.”</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">He put an arm
						around me and walked himself down the rest of the way.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Meanwhile, the Army
						rolled a tracked vehicle, a personnel carrier, up to the front door. Tommy
						went in with Ryan and they pulled away.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I ran back
						upstairs, feeling as if I’d been shot and wishing that it had been me, not

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I thought Ryan was

						but the other as well. It was a miracle that he lived.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">But at that moment

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">As soon as the ramp

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Marc Lee was at the

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">He never got the

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">On the way back, I

						into before they trained up for the main event. We were pretty careful with
						them—we didn’t allow them to go out on ops.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Being SEALs, they

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">We did have to haze

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">While we were in

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The new guy peeked

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“You don’t want to

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“Your funeral,”

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">New guy number two

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Just for a few

				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1 x1bm-after-txb1-override" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="initial-caps initial-caps-override">W</span><span class="no-style-override">e also hazed a new-guy officer. He got about what

						man.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">In BUD/S, officers
						and enlisted are all treated the same: like shit. Once you make it through
						and join the Teams, you’re a new guy. Again, all new guys are treated the
						same: like shit.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Most officers take
						it fairly well, though obviously there are exceptions. The truth is, the
						Teams are run by the senior enlisted. A guy who’s a chief has twelve to
						sixteen years of experience. An officer joining a platoon has far less, not
						just in SEALs but in the Navy as well. Most of the time he just doesn’t know
						shit. Even an OIC might have only four or five years’ experience.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">That’s the way the
						system works. If he’s lucky, an officer might get as many as three platoons;
						after that, he’s promoted to task unit commander (or something similar) and
						no longer works directly in the field. Even to get there, much of what he’s
						done has been admin work and things like de-confliction (making sure a unit
						doesn’t get fired on by another one). Those are important tasks, but they’re
						not quite the same as hands-on combat. When it comes to door-kicking or
						setting up a sniper hide, the officer’s experience generally doesn’t run too
						deep.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">There are
						exceptions, of course. I worked with some great officers with good
						experience, but as a general rule, an officer’s knowledge of down-and-dirty
						combat is just nowhere near the same as the guy with many years of combat
						under his belt. I used to tease LT that when we did a DA, he would be in the
						stack, ready to go in, not with a rifle but his tactical
					computer.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Hazing helps remind
						everybody where the experience lies—and who you better look to when the shit
						hits the fan. It also shows the people who have been around a little bit
						what to expect from the new guys. Compare and contrast: who do you want on
						your back, the guy who ran in to save his buddy or the officer who shed
						tears because he was being mistreated by some dirty enlisted men?</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Hazing humbles all
						the new guys, reminding them that they don’t know shit yet. In the case of
						an officer, that dose of humility can go a long way.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I’ve had good

						easier than it had been. We didn’t go as far from the COPs, which meant that
						we didn’t draw as much fire.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">With our heads back

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I was up on the

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Our com guy had

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">We worked with

						of eyes above you, and being able to talk to the people who own those eyes,
						can help you figure things out.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">(The Apaches had
						different ROEs than we did. These especially came into play when firing
						Hellfire missiles, which could only be used against crew-served weapons at

						we relied on their night sensors, which gave them a good picture of the
						battlefield even in the pitch black.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">One night we hit a

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I peeled off with a

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">His mother jumped

						Further complicating things, the Marines took down a dump truck suspected of

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Ordinarily, that

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The way I figure

						and generals—let them supervise us, not some fat-ass congressman sitting in
						a leather chair smoking a cigar back in DC in an air-conditioned office,
						telling me when and where I can and cannot shoot someone.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">How would they

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">And once you decide

						the end result you want, and you’ll get it. But don’t try and tell us how to

						lives in danger.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The ROEs got so
						convoluted and fucked-up because politicians were interfering in the
						process. The rules are drawn up by lawyers who are trying to protect the
						admirals and generals from the politicians; they’re not written by people
						who are worried about the guys on the ground getting shot.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1 x1bm-after-txb1-override" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="initial-caps initial-caps-override">F</span><span class="no-style-override">or some reason, a lot of people back home—not all

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">According to the

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Taya tried to sound

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">My wife sounded so

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The stress of the
						deployment had started to get to me well before that phone call in September
						2006. The loss of Marc and Ryan’s extreme injuries had taken a toll. My
						blood pressure had shot up and I couldn’t sleep. Hearing the news about my
						daughter pushed me to my breaking point. I wasn’t much good for
						anyone.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Fortunately, we
						were already winding down our deployment. And as soon as I mentioned my
						little girl’s condition to my command, they started making travel
						arrangements to get me home. Our doctor put through the paperwork for a Red
						Cross letter. That’s a statement that indicates a service member’s family
						needs him for an emergency back home. Once that letter arrived, my
						commanders made it happen.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1 x1bm-after-txb1-override" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="initial-caps initial-caps-override">I</span><span class="no-style-override"> almost didn’t get out. Ramadi was such a hot zone

						attacks. Worried about me and knowing I couldn’t afford to wait too long, my
						boys loaded up the Humvees. They set me in the middle, and drove me out of
						the city to TQ airfield.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">When we got there,

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">My guys were going

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">It was a

						for them but for him. I asked a couple questions and the careful responses
						told me how dangerous his extract was going to be.</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">I felt

				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">It was

				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">I felt
						sad for everything he’d been through. And I felt terribly torn about needing

						without him so much that I developed an attitude that I didn’t need him, or
						at least that I shouldn’t need him.</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">I guess
						it may not make any sense to anyone else, but I felt this strange mixture of
						feelings, all across the spectrum. I was so mad at him for leaving the kids
						and me on our own. I wanted him home but I was mad, too.</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">I was
						coming off months of anxiety for his safety and frustration that he chose to
						keep going back. I wanted to count on him, but I couldn’t. His Team could,
						and total strangers who happened to be in the military could, but the kids
						and I certainly could not.</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">It

				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">All the

				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">I guess
						I had had an undercurrent of anger that whole deployment. We’d have

						would say, “I’m mad at you for going back. But I don’t want to hate you, and
						I don’t want to be mad. I know you could be killed tomorrow. I don’t want
						you to be distracted by this. I don’t want to have this

				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">Now

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I remember

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">These were long

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">One of the things

						to all men—whenever she heard a male voice, she would cry.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Whatever the

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Things were better
						with my son, who remembered me and now was older and more ready to play. But
						once again, the normal troubles that parents have with their kids and with
						each other were compounded by the separation and stress we’d all just gone
						through.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Little things could
						really be annoying. I expected my son to look me in the eye when I was
						scolding him. Taya was bothered by this, because she felt he wasn’t
						accustomed to me or my tone and it was too much to ask a two-year-old to
						look me in the eye in that situation. But my feeling was just the opposite.
						It was the right thing for him to do. He wasn’t being corrected by a
						stranger. He was being disciplined by someone who loved him. There’s a
						certain two-way road of respect there. You look me in the eye, I look you in
						the eye—we understand each other.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Taya would say,
						“Wait a minute. You’ve been gone for how long? And now you want to come home

						leaving again in another month to go back on training.”</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">We were both right,

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I got off the phone

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">They were long

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Finally I found out
						Mike Monsoor, a member of our sister platoon, had been killed saving the
						lives of some of his fellow platoon members in Ramadi. The group had set up

						grenade.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Obviously, I wasn’t

				<p class="x1ext-first" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The grenade
						hit him in the chest and bounced onto the deck [here, the Navy term for
						floor]. He immediately leapt to his feet and yelled “grenade” to alert his
						teammates of impending danger, but they could not evacuate the sniper
						hide-sight in time to escape harm. Without hesitation and showing no regard
						for his own life, he threw himself onto the grenade, smothering it to
						protect his teammates who were lying in close proximity. The grenade
						detonated as he came down on top of it, mortally wounding him.</span></p>
				<p class="x1ext-last" xml:lang="en-us">Petty Officer Monsoor’s actions could not have
					been more selfless or clearly intentional. Of the three SEALs on that rooftop
					corner, he had the only avenue of escape away from the blast, and if he had so
					chosen, he could have easily escaped. Instead, Monsoor chose to protect his
					comrades by the sacrifice of his own life. By his courageous and selfless
					actions, he saved the lives of his two fellow SEALs.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us">He was later awarded the Medal of Honor.</p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">A lot of memories
						about Mikey came back as soon as I found out he’d died. I hadn’t known him
						all that well, because he was in the other platoon, but I was there for his
						hazing.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I remember us
						holding him down so his head could be shaved. He didn’t like that at all; I
						may still have some bruises.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1 x1bm-after-txb1-override" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="initial-caps initial-caps-override">I</span><span class="no-style-override"> drove a van to pick up some of the guys from the

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">SEAL funerals are
						kind of like Irish wakes, except there’s a lot more drinking. Which begs the
						question, how much beer do you need for a SEAL wake? That is classified
						information, but rest assured it is more than a metric ass-ton.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I stood on the
						tarmac in dress blues as the plane came in. My arm went up in a stiff salute
						as the coffin came down the ramp, then, with the other pallbearers, I
						carried it slowly to the waiting hearse.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">We attracted a bit
						of a crowd at the airport. People nearby who realized what was going on
						stopped and stared silently, paying their respects. It was touching; they
						were honoring a fellow countryman even though they didn’t know him. I was
						moved at the sight, a last honor for our fallen comrade, a silent
						recognition of the importance of his sacrifice.</span></p>

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">It’s become a sign

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">As the guys from
						Delta Platoon lined up to pound their tridents into Mikey’s coffin, I backed

						I’d still been overseas, and still hadn’t had a chance to pay my respects.
						Now it suddenly seemed appropriate to put my trident on his

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I walked over

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Before passing out
						from blood loss after he’d been shot, Ryan had been able to see. But as his
						brain swelled with internal bleeding, bone or bullet fragments that were in
						his eye severed his optic nerves. There was no hope for restoring
						sight.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">When I saw him, I
						asked him why he’d insisted on walking out of the building under his own
						power. It struck me as a remarkably brave thing—characteristic of him. Ryan
						told me he knew that our procedures called for at least two guys to go down
						with him if he couldn’t move on his own. He didn’t want to take more guys
						out of the fight.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I think he thought

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Ryan left the

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Well, Scruff kind

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">We went back over

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">And on and on.

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I got out on bail

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Somewhere around

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">There are similar

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“All right,” he

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">But the worst of

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">There was a stretch

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“Do you understand

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">He just laughed. He

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I always thought

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">After years of

						to push her away. At the same time, an old girlfriend happened to get in

						about straying.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I laughed off the

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Taya figured out

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“We have to be able

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">We had a long,

				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">I

				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">She

				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">I took
						her advice. It was a hard, hard conversation.</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">But I
						knew several things in my heart. First, I knew I loved Chris. And second,
						and this was very important to me, I knew that he was a good dad. I’d seen
						him with our son, and with our daughter. He had a strong sense of discipline
						and respect, and at the same time had so much fun with the kids that by the

				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">From my

				<p class="x1story-last" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">So

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I’d like to say
						that things instantly got better from that point on. But life really isn’t

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">One issue that we
						didn’t completely resolve had to do with my enlistment, and how it would fit

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Taya made it clear

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">But I also felt as
						if I had a duty to my country. I had been trained to kill; I was very good

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">And I liked doing

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I went back and

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">In the end, I

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I told her I would

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I still wonder

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Now, I like war,

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Of course I didn’t

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Still, it felt good

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I scanned the
						darkness through my night vision, tense as we made our way down one of the
						nastiest streets in Sadr City. We walked past a row of what might have been
						condos in a normal city. Here they were little better than rat-infested
						slums. It was past midnight in early April 2008, and, against all common
						sense but under direct orders, we were walking into the center of an
						insurgent hellhole.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Like a lot of the
						other drab-brown buildings on the street, the house we were heading to had a
						metal grate in front of the door. We lined up to breach it. Just then,
						someone appeared from behind the grate at the door and said something in
						Arabic.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Our interpreter

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">One of the other

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">Shit!</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“Go!” I yelled.
						“Break the grate the fuck in.”</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">We rushed in and
						started clearing the house. The two bottom levels were empty.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I raced up the
						stairs to the third floor and moved to the doorway of a room facing the
						street, leaning back against the wall as the rest of my guys stacked to
						follow. As I started to take a step, the whole room blew up.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">By some miracle, I

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Nobody. And the

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Gunfire followed.
						We regrouped. The Iraqi who’d been inside had clearly escaped to alert the
						nearby insurgents where we were. Worse, the walls in the house proved pretty
						flimsy, unable to stand up to the rocket grenades that were being fired at
						us. If we stayed here, we were going to get fried.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Out of the

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">The last of my
						guys had just cleared out of the building when the street shook with a huge

						powerful it knocked a few of us off our feet. Ears ringing, we ran to
						another building nearby. But as we were fixing to enter it, all hell broke
						loose. We got gunfire from every direction, including above.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">A shot flew into my

						who owned the base were in the process of shutting it down, meaning that
						we’d have to move out soon after we set it up. I have no idea what the logic
						was.</span></p>

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">According to the

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">Shit,</span><span class="no-style-override"> I thought, </span><span class="italic italic-override">we’re going to Iran.</span></p>

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I was convoyed over
						to al-Asad, the big airbase in al-Anbar Province, where our top head shed

				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1 x1bm-after-txb1-override" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="initial-caps initial-caps-override">L</span><span class="no-style-override">ocated on the outskirts of Baghdad, Sadr City had
						become even more of a snake pit since the last time I’d been with the GROMs
						a few years before. Two million Shiites lived there. The rabidly
						anti-American cleric Muqtada al-Sadr (the city had been named for his
						father) had been steadily building his militia, the Mahdi Army (known in
						Arabic as the </span><span class="italic italic-override">Jaish
						al-Mahdi</span><span class="no-style-override">). There were other
						insurgents operating in the area, but the Mahdi Army was by far the biggest
						and most powerful.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">With covert help
						from Iran, the insurgents had gathered arms and started launching mortars
						and rockets into Baghdad’s Green Zone. The entire place was a vipers’ nest.
						Like Fallujah and Ramadi, there were different cliques and varying levels of
						expertise among the insurgents. The people here were mostly Shiites, whereas
						my earlier battles in Iraq had been primarily with Sunnis. But otherwise it
						was a very familiar hellhole.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">This was all fine
						with me.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1 x1bm-after-txb1-override" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="initial-caps initial-caps-override">T</span><span class="no-style-override">hey pulled snipers and JTACs, along with some
						officers and chiefs, from Teams 3 and 8 to create a special task unit. There
						were about thirty of us altogether. In a way it was an all-star team, with
						some of the best of the best guys in the country. And it was very
						sniper-heavy, because the idea was to implement some of the tactics we’d
						used in Fallujah, Ramadi, and elsewhere.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">There was a lot of
						talent, but because we were drawn from all different units, we needed to
						spend a bit of time getting used to each other. Small differences in the way
						East Coast and West Coast teams typically operated could make for a big
						problem in a firefight. We also had a lot of personnel decisions to make,
						selecting point men and the like.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1 x1bm-after-txb1-override" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="initial-caps initial-caps-override">T</span><span class="no-style-override">he Army had decided to create a buffer zone to
						push the insurgents far enough away that their rockets would reach the Green
						Zone. One of the keys to this was erecting a wall in Sadr City—basically, a
						huge cement fence called a “T-wall” that would run down a major thoroughfare
						about a quarter of the way into the slum. Our job was to protect the guys
						building that wall—and take down as many bad guys as possible in the
						process.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The boys building
						that wall had an insanely dangerous job. A crane would take one of the
						concrete sections off the back of a flatbed and haul it into place. As it
						was set down, a private would have to climb up and unhook it.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Under fire,
						generally. And not just pop shots—the insurgents would use any weapon they
						had, from AKs to RPGs. Those Army guys had serious balls.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1 x1bm-after-txb1-override" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="initial-caps initial-caps-override">A</span><span class="no-style-override"> Special Forces unit had already been operating in

						getting things all worked out and figuring out how we were going to skin
						this cat. Once everything was settled, we were dropped off at an Army FOB
						(forward operating base).</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">At this point, we
						were told we were going to foot patrol into Sadr City at night. A few of us
						argued that it didn’t make much sense—the place was crawling with people who
						wanted to kill us, and on foot we’d be easy targets.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">But someone thought
						it would be smart if we walked in during the middle of the night. Sneak in,
						they told us, and there won’t be trouble.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">So we

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">There I was, shot
						in the head and blind. Blood streamed down my face. I reached up to my
						scalp. I was surprised—not only was my head still there, but it was intact.
						But I knew I’d been shot.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Somehow I realized
						that my helmet, which hadn’t been strapped, had been pushed back. I pulled
						it forward. Suddenly I could see again. A bullet had struck the helmet, but
						with incredible luck had ricocheted off my night vision, slamming the helmet
						backward but otherwise not harming me. When I pulled it forward, I brought
						the scope back down in front of my eyes, and could see again. I hadn’t been
						rendered blind at all, but in the confusion I couldn’t tell what was going
						on.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">A few seconds
						later, I got hit in the back with a heavy round. The bullet pushed me
						straight to the ground. Fortunately, the round hit one of the plates in my
						body armor.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Still, it left me
						dazed. Meanwhile, we were surrounded. We called to each other and organized
						a retreat to a marketplace we’d passed on the way in. We started laying down
						fire and moving together.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">By this time, the
						blocks around us looked like the worst scenes in </span><span class="italic italic-override">Black Hawk Down</span><span class="no-style-override">. It seemed like every insurgent, maybe every
						occupant, wanted a piece of the idiot Americans who’d foolishly blundered
						into Sadr City.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">We couldn’t get
						into the building we retreated to. By now we’d called for QRF—a quick
						response force, a fancy name for the cavalry. We needed backup and
						extraction—“HELP” in capital letters.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">A group of Army
						Strykers came in. Strykers are heavily armed personnel carriers, and they
						were firing everything they had. There were plenty of targets—upward of a
						hundred insurgents lined the roofs on the surrounding streets, trying to get
						us. When they saw the Strykers, they changed their aim, trying to take out
						the Army’s big personnel carriers. There they were overmatched. It started
						looking like a video game—guys were falling off the rooftops.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“Motherfucker,
						thank you,” I said aloud when the vehicles reached our building. I swear I
						could hear a cavalry horn somewhere in the background.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">They dropped their
						ramps and we ran inside.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“Did you see how
						many motherfuckers were up there?” said one of the crewmen as the vehicle
						sped back to the base.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“No,” I answered.
						“I was too busy shooting.”</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“They were all over
						the place.” The kid was stoked. “We were dropping them and that wasn’t even
						half of them. We were just laying it down. We thought y’all were fuckin’
						done.”</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">That made more than
						two of us.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1 x1bm-after-txb1-override" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="initial-caps initial-caps-override">T</span><span class="no-style-override">hat night scared the shit out of me. That’s when I

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">All through

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">But I never did
						die. Those thoughts were fleeting. They evaporated.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">After a while, I

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Trying to sneak
						into Sadr City was not going to work, and command should have known that
						from the start. The bad guys would always know we were there. So we would
						just have to make the most of it.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Two days after
						getting our butts kicked out of the city, we came back, this time riding in
						Strykers. We took over a place known as the banana factory. This was a
						building four or five stories high, filled with fruit lockers and assorted
						factory gear, most of it wrecked by looters long before we got there. I’m
						not sure exactly what it had to do with bananas or what the Iraqis might
						have done there; all I knew at the time was that it was a good place for a
						sniper hide.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Wanting a little
						more cover than I would have had on the roof, I set up in the top floor.
						Around nine o’clock in the morning, I realized the number of civilians
						walking up and down the street had started to thin. That was always a
						giveaway—they spotted something and knew they didn’t want to end up in the
						line of fire.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">A few minutes
						later, with the street now deserted, an Iraqi came out of a partially
						destroyed building. He was armed with an AK-47. When he reached the street
						he ducked down, scouting in the direction of the engineers who were working
						down the road on the wall, apparently trying to pick one out to target. As
						soon as I was sure what he was up to, I aimed center-mass and
					fired.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">He was forty yards
						away. He fell, dead.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">An hour later,
						another guy poked his head out from behind a wall on another part of the
						street. He glanced in the direction of the T-wall, then pulled
					back.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">It may have seemed
						innocent to someone else—and certainly didn’t meet the ROEs—but I knew to
						watch more carefully. I’d seen insurgents follow this same pattern now for
						years. They would peek out, glance around, then disappear. I called them
						“peekers”—they “peeked” out to see if anyone was watching. I’m sure they
						knew they couldn’t be shot for glancing around.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I knew it, too. But
						I also knew that if I was patient, the guy or whoever he was spotting for
						would most likely reappear. Sure enough, the fellow reappeared a few moments
						later.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">He had an RPG in
						his hand. He knelt quickly, bringing it up to aim.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I dropped him
						before he could fire.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Then it became a

						someone would be sent to get it.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I watched. It
						seemed like forever. Finally, a figure came down the street and scooped up
						the grenade launcher.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">It was a kid. A
						child.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I had a clear view

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Because of the way
						the streets were laid out and the number of insurgents, we were getting
						close shots—a number were as close as 200 yards. My longest during this time
						was only about 880; the average was around 400.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The city around us
						was schizophrenic. You’d have ordinary civilians going about their business,
						selling things, going to market, whatever. And then you’d have guys with
						guns trying to sneak up on the side streets and attack the soldiers putting
						up the wall. After we began engaging the insurgents, we would become the
						targets ourselves. Everyone would know where we were, and the bad guys would
						come out of their slug holes and try and take us down.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">It got to the point
						where I had so many kills that I stepped back to let the other guys have a
						few. I started giving them the best spots in the buildings we took over.
						Even so, I had plenty of chances to shoot.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">One day we took
						over this house and, after letting my guys choose their places, there were
						no more windows to fire from. So I took a sledgehammer and broke a hole in

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">When I finally set
						up my place, I had about a three-hundred-yard view. Just as I got on my gun,

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I killed all of

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">We learned to bump

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">At some point I saw

						wasn’t doing anything dangerous, so I let him be.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">A little while

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">At 2,100 yards,

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Maybe the way I

						got a field promotion to E5 during my second deployment and made E6 thanks
						to a special merit program before my third deployment. Both came without
						taking written tests.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">(In both cases I
						had been doing a lot of extra work within the Team, and had made a
						reputation on the battlefield. Those were the important factors in awarding
						the new ranks.)</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">That didn’t fly for

				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1 x1bm-after-txb1-override" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="initial-caps initial-caps-override">I</span><span class="no-style-override"> should explain a bit more about written tests and

						than anyone else. But the tests for SEALs added an extra burden.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">At the time, in
						order to get promoted, you had to take an exam in your job area—not as a
						SEAL, but in whatever area you had selected before being a SEAL. In my case,
						that would have meant being evaluated in the intelligence area.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Obviously, I wasn’t
						in a position to know anything about that area. I was a SEAL, not an
						intelligence analyst. I didn’t have a clue what sort of equipment and
						procedures intel used to get their jobs done.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Considering the

						Or just a fine pair of dice.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">In order to get
						promoted, I would have had to study for the test, which would have involved
						going to a secure reading area, a special room where top-secret material can
						be reviewed. Of course, I would have had to do this in my spare
					time.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">There weren’t any
						secure reading areas in Fallujah or Ramadi where I fought. And the
						literature in the latrines and heads wouldn’t have cut it.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">(The tests are now
						in the area of special operations, and pertain to things SEALs actually do.
						The exams are incredibly detailed, but at least it has to do with our

						was on things SEALs should know.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">That hurdle
						cleared, my case had to be reviewed by a board and then go through further
						administrative review by the upper echelon. The board review process
						included all these chief petty officers and master chiefs sitting down and
						reviewing a package of my accomplishments. The package is supposed to be a
						long dossier of everything you’ve done as a SEAL. (Minus the bar
						fights.)</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">The only thing in
						my package was my service record. But that had not been updated since I
						graduated BUD/S. My Silver Stars and Bronze Medals weren’t even in
						there.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I wasn’t crazy
						about becoming a chief. I was happy where I was. As chief, I would have all
						sorts of administrative duties, and I wouldn’t get as much action. Yes, it
						was more money for our family, but I wasn’t thinking about that.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Chief Primo was on
						the review board back at our base in the States. He was sitting next to one
						of the chiefs when they began reviewing my case.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“Who the hell is
						this dipshit?” said the other chief when he saw my thin folder. “Who does he
						think he is?”</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“Why don’t you and
						I go to lunch?” said Primo.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">He agreed. The

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">“You owe me a

						told me the story.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I owe him all that
						and more. The promotion came through, and, to be honest, being chief wasn’t

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I’d do my homework
						in the truck in the morning. When they stuck me in the Honor Society, I made

						I brought them up again so my parents wouldn’t get on me.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Maybe the rank
						thing had to do with the fact that I preferred being a leader on the ground,
						rather than an administrator in a back room. I didn’t want to have to sit at
						a computer, plan everything, then tell everyone about it. I wanted to do my
						thing, which was being a sniper—get into combat, kill the enemy. I wanted to
						be the best at what I wanted to do.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I think a lot of
						people had trouble with that attitude. They naturally thought that anyone

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Willie Nelson
						cranked through the speaker system of our Hummer as we set out for our base
						the next day. Music was about the only diversion we had out here, outside of
						the occasional stop in a village to talk to the locals. Besides the
						old-school country my buddy behind the wheel preferred, I listened to a bit
						of Toby Keith and Slipknot, country and heavy metal vying for
						attention.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I’m a big believer
						in the psychological impact of music. I’ve seen it work on the battlefield.
						If you’re going into combat, you want to be pumped up. You don’t want to be
						stupid crazy, but you do want to be psyched. Music can help take the fear
						away. We’d listen to Papa Roach, Dope, Drowning Pool—anything that amped us
						up. (They’re all in heavy rotation on my workout mix now.)</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">But nothing could
						amp me up on the way back to base. It was a long, hot ride. Even though I’d
						just gotten some good news about my promotion, I was in a dark mood, bored
						on the one hand, and tense on the other.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Back at base,
						things were incredibly slow. Nothing was going on. And it started to get to
						me.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">As long as I had
						been in action, the idea of my being vulnerable, being mortal, had been
						something I could push away. There was too much going on to worry about it.
						Or rather, I had so much else to do, I didn’t really focus on it.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">But now, it was
						practically all I could think of.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I had time to

						I’d been through—getting shot especially.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I relived the
						gunshot every time I lay down to rest. My heart thumped hard in my chest,
						probably a lot harder than it had that night in Sadr City.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Things seemed to go
						downhill in the few days after we got back from our border patrol. I
						couldn’t sleep. I felt very jumpy. Extremely jumpy. And my blood pressure
						shot up again, even higher than before.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I felt like I was
						going to explode.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Physically, I was
						beat up. Four long combat deployments had taken their toll. My knees felt
						better, but my back hurt, my ankle hurt, my hearing was screwed up. My ears
						rang. My neck had been injured, my ribs cracked. My fingers and knuckles had
						been broken. I had floaters and decreased vision in my right eye. There were
						dozens of deep bruises and an assortment of aches and pains. I was a
						doctor’s wet dream.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">But the thing that
						really bothered me was my blood pressure. I sweated buckets and my hands

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Imagine climbing a

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">So you do. You

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">They also suggested

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">To be honest, it

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">To top things off,

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Well, in the

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">When I think about

						to a flag and give him some time.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">He sat in his

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Of course we all

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">When he moved away,

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Meanwhile, the

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I had a number of

						foremost snipers in their army, and had served over twenty years as a sniper
						and sniper platoon commander. Mark has written three books on sniping and is
						one of the world’s leading experts on the subject.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">We both realized

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Money, of course,

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Kyle had made a lot
						of money investing, and when we met, he was looking for a bodyguard. I guess
						he figured, “Who better than a SEAL?” But when we got talking and he asked
						where I saw myself in a few years, I told him about the school. He was
						intrigued, and rather than hiring me as his bodyguard, he helped provide the
						financing for our company. And just like that, Craft International was
						born.</span></p>

						more to do with the business side of things, but they’re both knowledgeable
						about weapons and the tactics that we teach.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Today, Craft

						where being a SEAL no longer defines me. I need to be a husband and a
						father. Those things, now, are my first calling.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Being a SEAL has
						been a huge part of me. I still feel the pull. I certainly would have
						preferred having the best of both worlds—the job </span><span class="italic italic-override">and</span><span class="no-style-override">
						the family. But at least in my case, the job wouldn’t allow it.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I’m not sure I
						would have either. In a sense, I had to step away from the job to become the
						fuller man my family needed me to be.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I don’t know where
						or when the change came. It didn’t happen until I got out. I had to get
						through that resentment at first. I had to move through the good things and
						the bad things to reach a point where I could really move ahead.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Now I want to be a
						good dad and a good husband. Now I’ve rediscovered a real love for my wife.
						I genuinely miss her when I’m on a business trip. I want to be able to hug
						her and sleep next to her.</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-au" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="bold">Taya: </span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">What I
						loved about Chris in the beginning was the way he unabashedly wore his heart
						on his sleeve. He didn’t play games with my heart or my head. He was a
						straight shooter who seemed to back up his feelings in actions: spending an
						hour and a half to drive up to see me, then leaving in time for work at five
						a.m.; communicating; putting up with my moods.</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">His
						sense of fun balanced out my serious side and brought out the youthful side
						of me. He was up for anything and completely supportive of anything I wanted
						or dreamed of. He got along famously with my family and I did with
						his.</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">When
						our marriage reached a crisis, I said I wouldn’t love him the same if he
						reenlisted again. It wasn’t that I didn’t love him, but I felt that his
						decision would confirm what I thought was becoming increasingly evident. In
						the beginning, I believed he loved me more than anything. Slowly the Teams
						started to become his first love. He continued to say the words and tell me
						what he felt I needed to hear and what he had always said in the past to
						express his love. The difference is, the words and actions were no longer
						meshing. He still loved me but it was different. He was consumed by the
						Teams.</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">When he
						was away, he would tell me things like “I would do anything to be home with
						you,” and “I miss you,” and “You are the most important thing in the world
						to me.” I knew if he joined up again that all of what he had been telling me
						over the past years were mostly words or feelings in theory, rather than
						feelings expressed in actions.</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">How
						could I love with the same reckless abandon if I knew I was not what he said
						I was? I was second fiddle at best.</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">He
						would die for strangers and country. My challenges and pain seemed to be
						mine alone. He wanted to live his life and have a happy wife to come home
						to.</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">At the
						time, it meant everything I loved in the beginning was changing and I would
						have to love him differently. I thought it might be less, but it turns out
						it was just different.</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">Just
						like in any relationship, things changed. We changed. We both made mistakes
						and we both learned a lot. We may love each other differently, but maybe
						that is a good thing. Maybe it is more forgiving and more mature, or maybe
						it is just different.</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">It is
						still really good. We still have each other’s backs and we’ve learned that
						even through the tough times, we don’t want to lose each other or the family
						we’ve built.</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-last" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">The
						more time that goes by the more we are each able to show each other love in
						ways the other one understands and feels.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I feel like my love
						for my wife has gotten deeper over the past few years. Taya bought me a new
						wedding ring made of tungsten steel—I don’t think it’s a coincidence that
						it’s the hardest metal she could find.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">It has crusader
						crosses on it, too. She jokes that it’s because marriage is like a
						crusade.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Maybe for us it has
						been.</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-au" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="bold">Taya: </span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">I feel
						something coming from him that I hadn’t felt before.</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">He’s
						definitely not the person he was before the war, but there are a lot of the
						same qualities. His sense of humor, his kindness, his warmth, his courage,
						and a sense of responsibility. His quiet confidence inspires me.</span></p>
				<p class="x1story-mid" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">Like
						any couple, we still have our day-to-day life things we have to work
						through, but most importantly, I feel loved. And I feel the kids and I are
						important.</span></p>

						war.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">No one is. Before
						you’re in combat, you have this innocence about you. Then, all of a sudden,
						you see this whole other side of life.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I don’t regret any

						death.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">As a SEAL, you go
						to the Dark Side. You’re immersed in it. Continually going to war, you
						gravitate to the blackest parts of existence. Your psyche builds up its
						defenses—that’s why you laugh at gruesome things like heads being blown
						apart, and worse.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Growing up, I
						wanted to be military. But I wondered, how would I feel about killing
						someone?</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Now I know. It’s no
						big deal.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I did it a lot more
						than I’d ever thought I would—or, for that matter, more than any American
						sniper before me. But I also witnessed the evil my targets committed and
						wanted to commit, and by killing them, I protected the lives of many fellow
						soldiers.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1 x1bm-after-txb1-override" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="initial-caps initial-caps-override">I</span><span class="no-style-override"> don’t spend a lot of time philosophizing about

					war.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I am a strong
						Christian. Not a perfect one—not close. But I strongly believe in God,
						Jesus, and the Bible. When I die, God is going to hold me accountable for
						everything I’ve done on earth.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">He may hold me back
						until last and run everybody else through the line, because it will take so
						long to go over all my sins.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="italic italic-override">“Mr. Kyle,
						let’s go into the backroom.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Honestly, I don’t
						know what will really happen on Judgment Day. But what I lean toward is that
						you know all of your sins, and God knows them all, and shame comes over you
						at the reality that He knows. I believe the fact that I’ve accepted Jesus as
						my savior will be my salvation.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">But in that
						backroom or whatever it is when God confronts me with my sins, I do not
						believe any of the kills I had during the war will be among them. Everyone I
						shot was evil. I had good cause on every shot. They all deserved to
						die.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm-after-txb1 x1bm-after-txb1-override" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="initial-caps initial-caps-override">M</span><span class="no-style-override">y regrets are about the people I couldn’t

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I still feel their
						loss. I still ache for my failure to protect them.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I’m not naive and
						I’m beyond romanticizing war and what I had to do there. The worst moments
						of my life have come as a SEAL. Losing my buddies. Having a kid die on
						me.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I’m sure some of
						the things I went through pale in comparison to what some of the guys went
						through in World War II and other conflicts. On top of all the shit they
						went through in Vietnam, they had to come home to a country that spat on
						them.</span></p>
				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">When people ask me

				<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I don’t give a shit

			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I’d also like to thank my wife, Taya, for helping me write this book and making her own contributions. My brother and my parents supplied their memories as well as their support. Several of my friends also kindly provided information that was invaluable. Among those who were especially helpful were one of my lieutenants and a fellow sniper who appear as LT and Dauber in this book, respectively. Marc Lee’s mom also helped with some key insights.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Special thanks and appreciation go to Jim DeFelice for his patience, wit, understanding, and writing ability. Without his help, this book would not be what it is today. I also want to express my sincere appreciation to Jim’s wife and son for opening their home to Taya and me as this book developed.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">We worked on this book in a variety of places. None matched the comfort of Marc Myers’s ranch, which he very generously allowed us to use while we worked.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">Scott McEwen recognized the value of my story before I did, and played a critical role in bringing it to print.</span></p>
			<p class="x1bm" xml:lang="en-us"><span class="no-style-override">I’d like to thank my editor, Peter Hubbard, who contacted me directly about writing this book and connected us with Jim DeFelice. Thanks also to the entire staff at William Morrow/HarperCollins.</span></p>
